## Executive Summary

FDAM is a systematic framework for assessing fire-damaged properties and generating scientifically defensible restoration documentation. The methodology synthesizes regulatory standards, industry guidance, and empirical field data from IHC fire restoration projects.

**FDAM produces three deliverables:**

1. **Cleaning Specification / Scope of Work** — Scope, methods, labor, equipment, and acceptance criteria
2. **Results Interpretation** — Threshold justification, regulatory basis, and pass/fail determination
3. **Executive Summary Report** — Completion verification and compliance documentation

**Standards Basis:**
- Metals clearance: BNL SOP IH75190 (Rev23, 06/23/17)
- Non-Operational alternative: Army/Air Force National Guard Indoor Firing Range Guidelines (200 µg/ft²)
- Air filtration: NADCA ACR 2021 (4 ACH minimum)
- Zone framework: IICRC/RIA/CIRI Technical Guide (December 2025)
- Particulate clearance: IHC professional judgment with empirical validation

---

## Part 1: Methodology Foundation

### 1.1 Scientific Basis

FDAM synthesizes:

- **Regulatory frameworks:** OSHA Technical Manual, NIOSH sampling methods, EPA clearance standards
- **Industry standards:** IICRC S700/S760, IICRC/RIA/CIRI Technical Guide, NADCA ACR, RIA Fire & Smoke Damage Repair
- **Published guidance:** BNL SOP IH75190, AIHA Technical Guide for Wildfire Impact Assessments
- **Empirical validation:** IHC field data from commercial fire restoration projects (see Appendix B)

### 1.2 Regulatory Framework

| Source | Application | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| BNL SOP IH75190 (Rev23) | Surface wipe clearance for metals | **Primary - verified** |
| Army/Air Force National Guard Guidelines | Non-Operational lead alternative (200 µg/ft²) | **Primary - verified** |
| EPA/HUD Lead Dust Hazard Standards (October 2024) | Public/Childcare lead clearance | **Primary - verified** |
| OSHA Technical Manual, Section II Ch. 2 | Surface contaminant methodology, facility classification | Referenced |
| NIOSH Method 9100 | Surface wipe sampling procedures | Referenced |
| 29 CFR 1910.1025 | Lead housekeeping requirements | Referenced |
| 29 CFR 1910.1018 | Arsenic housekeeping requirements | Referenced |
| 29 CFR 1910.1027 | Cadmium housekeeping requirements | Referenced |
| NADCA ACR 2021 | Air filtration requirements | **Primary - verified** |
| IICRC/RIA/CIRI Technical Guide (Dec 2025) | Zone-based assessment | **Primary - verified** |
| IICRC S520 | Mold remediation (cross-reference for fungal co-occurrence) | Referenced |

### 1.3 Threshold Classification

**Standards-Based Thresholds:** Values from published, peer-reviewed, or regulatory sources with explicit citations.

**Professional Judgment Thresholds:** Values developed through field experience where no published standards exist. Explicitly labeled with empirical validation data where available.

### 1.4 Metals Clearance Thresholds

**Source:** BNL SOP IH75190, Attachment 9.3 (Rev23, 06/23/17)

| Metal | Non-Operational | Operational | Unit | Regulatory Basis |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|------|------------------|
| Lead (Pb) | 22 | 500 | µg/100cm² | 29 CFR 1910.1025 |
| Cadmium (Cd) | 3.3 | 50 | µg/100cm² | 29 CFR 1910.1027 |
| Arsenic (As) | 6.7 | 100 | µg/100cm² | 29 CFR 1910.1018 |

**Unit Conversions:**
- µg/100cm² × 9.29 = µg/ft²
- Lead Non-Op: 22 µg/100cm² ≈ 204 µg/ft²

**Alternative Non-Operational Reference:**
Army and Air Force National Guard "Guidelines and Procedures for Rehabilitation and Conversion of Indoor Firing Ranges" establishes 200 µg/ft² as acceptable surface contamination for spaces converted to general use. This is consistent with BNL Non-Operational threshold (22 µg/100cm² ≈ 204 µg/ft²).

**Public/Childcare Thresholds (EPA/HUD October 2024):**

| Surface | Threshold | Unit |
|---------|-----------|------|
| Floors | 0.54 | µg/100cm² |
| Window Sills | 4.3 | µg/100cm² |
| Window Troughs | 4.3 | µg/100cm² |

### 1.5 Combustion Particle Definitions

Fire/combustion residue particles are classified into three categories based on combustion process:

| Category | Definition | Morphology |
|----------|------------|------------|
| **Soot** | Residues from combustion of organic resins and compounds | Aciniform (grape-like clusters); fine spherical particles; optically opaque |
| **Char** | Incomplete combustion of cellulose/vegetation material | Irregular angular fragments; carbonized plant structure visible; variable size |
| **Ash** | Residual mineral elements remaining after complete combustion (Ca, Na, Mg, K salts) | Irregular crystalline; often white/gray; variable opacity |

Source: Environmental Analysis Associates, Air-O-Cell Method Guide & Particle Atlas (2018)

**Laboratory Reporting Note:** Some laboratories report "Ash and Char" as a combined category. When combined reporting is used, interpret results against the Ash/Char threshold. When separated, sum the values for threshold comparison unless laboratory provides specific guidance.

### 1.6 Particulate Clearance Thresholds

**Classification:** Professional Judgment with Empirical Validation

| Analyte | Clearance Threshold | Unit | Validation Status |
|---------|---------------------|------|-------------------|
| Ash and Char (combined) | < 150 | particles/cm² | Validated (97.8% pass rate, n=45) |
| Aciniform Soot | < 500 | particles/cm² | Validated (91.1% pass rate, n=45) |
| Cellulose/Synthetic Fibers | < 500 | particles/cm² | Professional judgment |
| Silicates | < 1,500 | particles/cm² | Professional judgment |

**Laboratory Reference Comparison:**

| Particle Type | Lab "Normal" Range | FDAM Clearance | Position |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------|----------|
| Ash/Char | 0-300/cm² | < 150/cm² | 50% of upper normal |
| Aciniform Soot | 0-800/cm² | < 500/cm² | 62.5% of upper normal |

Source: Hayes Microbial Consulting, Estimated Normal Ranges based on ASTM D6602

FDAM clearance thresholds are set below laboratory "normal" ranges to ensure post-restoration surfaces are demonstrably cleaner than typical unaffected environments.

**Empirical Validation Summary:**
- Dataset: 45 post-restoration samples (QVC Distribution Center, March 2023)
- Pass rate at current thresholds: 93.3%
- Typical achievable post-cleaning levels: 5-15/cm² (both particle types)
- See Appendix B for complete analysis

**Application:**
- Evaluate in conjunction with visual inspection and odor assessment
- Compare to control/background samples from unaffected areas
- Results interpreted by qualified industrial hygienist

```
PHASE 1: PRE (Pre-Restoration Evaluation)
├── Site inspection and documentation
├── Contamination mapping
├── Material inventory
├── Zone classification (Burn/Near-Field/Far-Field)
└── Output: Preliminary findings, PRA recommendation

PHASE 2: PRA (Pre-Restoration Assessment)
├── Sampling plan development
├── Tape lift and surface wipe collection
├── Laboratory analysis
├── Results interpretation
└── Output: CLEANING SPECIFICATION / SCOPE OF WORK

PHASE 3: RESTORATION (Contractor Execution)

PHASE 4: PRV (Post-Restoration Verification)
├── Verification sampling
├── Laboratory analysis
├── Pass/fail determination
├── Reclean/retest if required
└── Output: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY REPORT
```

### 2.2 Phase 1: Pre-Restoration Evaluation (PRE)

**Field Activities:**

| Activity | Method | Data Captured |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| Site walk-through | Visual inspection | Affected areas, impact severity by zone |
| Odor assessment | Sensory | Presence/intensity/location of smoke odor |
| White wipe test | Clean cloth on surfaces | Preliminary contamination indicator |
| Photo documentation | Camera/device | Conditions, damage, access constraints |
| Material inventory | Visual identification | Surface types, quantities, restorability |
| Dimensional survey | Manual measurement | Room dimensions, surface areas |
| Zone classification | Distance from fire origin | Burn Zone / Near-Field / Far-Field |

**PRE Decision Logic:**

```
IF visible contamination is widespread
   OR odor is significant
   OR white wipe test shows deposits
   OR materials of concern present
   OR property is in Burn Zone or Near-Field Zone
THEN → Recommend PRA (laboratory assessment)

IF contamination is superficial
   AND limited to small area
   AND no materials of concern
   AND Far-Field Zone only
THEN → May proceed directly to cleaning specification
```

### 2.3 Phase 2: Pre-Restoration Assessment (PRA)

**Sampling Protocol:**

*Tape Lift Samples (Particulate Identification):*
- Minimum 1 per distinct surface type per zone
- Additional samples at contamination gradients
- Control samples from unaffected areas (recommended)
- Analysis: Polarized light microscopy (PLM)

*Surface Wipe Samples (Metals Quantification):*
- Per NIOSH Method 9100 / BNL SOP IH75190
- 100 cm² sample area (10cm × 10cm template)
- Ghost Wipes or equivalent pre-moistened media
- Analysis: ICP-MS or ICP-OES at AIHA-accredited laboratory

**Sample Density Guidelines:**

| Area Size | Tape Lifts | Surface Wipes |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| < 5,000 SF | 3-5 per surface type | 3-5 per surface type |
| 5,000 - 25,000 SF | 5-10 per surface type | 5-10 per surface type |
| 25,000 - 100,000 SF | 10-20 per surface type | 10-15 per surface type |
| > 100,000 SF | 20+ per surface type | 15-25 per surface type |

**Ceiling Deck Sample Density (Enhanced):**
Empirical data indicates ceiling deck surfaces exhibit higher post-cleaning contamination rates (82.4% pass rate vs 95%+ for other structural surfaces). For ceiling decks:
- Increase sample density by 50% above standard guidelines
- Minimum 1 sample per 2,500 SF (vs standard 1 per 5,000 SF)

**Qualitative Observation Checklist:**

Document the following at each sample location:

| Observation | Response | Notes |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| Smoke/fire odor present? | Yes / No | Intensity if present |
| Visible soot deposits? | Yes / No | Describe pattern |
| Large char particles observed? | Yes / No | Estimated density |
| Ash-like residue present? | Yes / No | Color, texture |
| Surface discoloration? | Yes / No | Describe |
| Dust loading or interference? | Yes / No | May affect lab accuracy |
| Burned soil/pollen/vegetation indicators? | Yes / No | Wildfire indicator |

This checklist supports visual-to-lab correlation and identifies potential analytical interferences.

### 2.4 Phase 4: Post-Restoration Verification (PRV)

**Verification Protocol:**
1. Visual inspection for dust-free surfaces
2. Odor assessment (no detectable fire/smoke odor)
3. Verification sampling (same methods as PRA)
4. Laboratory analysis
5. Results comparison to clearance criteria
6. Pass/fail determination by area

**PRV Decision Logic:**

```
IF all samples pass clearance thresholds
   AND visual inspection confirms dust-free
   AND no detectable odor
THEN → Issue clearance, generate Executive Summary

IF any samples exceed thresholds
THEN → Execute Reclean/Retest Protocol (Section 5.4)
```

## Part 3: Facility Classification

### 3.1 Classification Categories

| Classification | Definition | Lead Threshold | Applicable Standards |
|----------------|------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Operational | OSHA regulated substance used; workers trained; hygiene controls in place | 500 µg/100cm² | BNL SOP IH75190 Operational |
| Non-Operational | No regulated substance use; workers not trained; eating/drinking permitted | 22 µg/100cm² | BNL SOP IH75190 Non-Operational |
| Public-Childcare | Schools, daycare, child-occupied facilities | 0.54 µg/100cm² (floors) | EPA/HUD October 2024 |

### 3.2 Classification Determination

Facility classification is a professional judgment decision documented in the Results Interpretation deliverable. The determination considers:

- Facility use and occupancy type
- Presence of OSHA regulated substances
- Worker training status
- Personal hygiene controls (eating/drinking restrictions, handwashing requirements)
- Occupant populations (children, general public, trained workers)

### 3.3 Regulatory Justification Blocks

**Non-Operational Commercial/Industrial:**

> The indoor environment within [FACILITY] is comparable to the definition of a "Non-Operational Area" per OSHA Technical Manual Section II Chapter 2: an area where an OSHA Regulated Substance is not used and where workers are not trained in hazards and controls. Personal hygiene control practices are not in place (hand washing is not expected on exiting the area) and eating & drinking are permitted.
>
> The applicable standard for measuring cleaning performance is derived from BNL SOP IH75190 "Surface Wipe Sampling for Metals" (Rev23, 06/23/17), which establishes 22 µg/100cm² (≈204 µg/ft²) for Non-Operational areas. This threshold is consistent with the Army and Air Force National Guard "Guidelines and Procedures for Rehabilitation and Conversion of Indoor Firing Ranges" which establishes 200 µg/ft² as acceptable for spaces converted to general use.
>
> OSHA housekeeping provisions (29 CFR 1910.1025, 1910.1018, 1910.1027) require surfaces be maintained "as free as practicable" of accumulations of regulated metals.

**Operational Industrial:**

> [FACILITY] meets the definition of an "Operational Area" per OSHA Technical Manual Section II Chapter 2: an area where workers are routinely in the presence of an OSHA Regulated Substance as part of their work activity. Workers who handle the substance have been trained in hazards and controls. Substances are routinely used, handled or stored and personal hygiene control practices are in place.
>
> The applicable standard is BNL SOP IH75190 Operational threshold of 500 µg/100cm² for lead.

**Public-Childcare:**

> [FACILITY] is classified as a child-occupied facility subject to EPA/HUD Lead Dust Hazard Standards (October 2024). These standards establish protective thresholds for environments where children may be present.
>
> Applicable thresholds: 0.54 µg/100cm² (floors), 4.3 µg/100cm² (window sills and troughs).

## Part 4: Surface Assessment

### 4.1 Zone Classification

**Source:** IICRC/RIA/CIRI Technical Guide for Wildfire Restoration (December 2025)

| Zone | Definition | Typical Characteristics |
|------|------------|------------------------|
| Burn Zone | Direct fire involvement | Structural damage, char, complete combustion |
| Near-Field | Adjacent to burn zone, heavy smoke/heat exposure | Heavy soot deposits, heat damage, strong odor |
| Far-Field | Smoke migration without direct heat exposure | Light to moderate deposits, odor, no structural damage |

### 4.2 Condition Scale

| Condition | Visual Indicators |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Background | No visible contamination; equivalent to unaffected areas |
| Light | Faint discoloration; minimal deposits visible on white wipe |
| Moderate | Visible film or deposits; clear contamination on white wipe |
| Heavy | Thick deposits; surface texture obscured; strong odor |
| Structural Damage | Physical damage requiring repair before cleaning |

### 4.3 Disposition Matrix

**Non-Porous Surfaces (Steel, Concrete, Glass, Metal):**

| Zone | Condition | Disposition | Protocol |
|------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Any | Background | No action | Document only |
| Far-Field | Light | Clean | Standard protocol |
| Far-Field | Moderate | Clean | Full protocol |
| Near-Field | Light | Clean | Full protocol |
| Near-Field | Moderate | Clean | Aggressive protocol, multiple passes |
| Near-Field | Heavy | Clean | Aggressive protocol with verification sampling |
| Burn Zone | Any restorable | Clean | Post-structural repair; aggressive protocol |
| Any | Structural Damage | Remove/Repair | Beyond cleaning scope |

**Porous/Semi-Porous Surfaces (Drywall, Carpet, Insulation, Acoustic Tile):**

| Zone | Condition | Disposition | Rationale |
|------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Far-Field | Background | Evaluate | May clean if truly superficial |
| Far-Field | Light | Evaluate/Clean | Assessment determines restorability |
| Far-Field | Moderate+ | Remove | Porous materials absorb contaminants |
| Near-Field | Light+ | Remove | Porous materials absorb contaminants and VOCs |
| Burn Zone | Any | Remove | Cannot effectively decontaminate |

### 4.4 Material Disposition Categories

**Tier 1: Generally Replace When Fire/Smoke Affected**

| Material | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Fiberglass insulation | Absorbs particulates and VOCs into fiber matrix |
| Flexible ductwork | Interior lining absorbs contaminants; cannot effectively clean |
| HVAC duct interior insulation | Porous material in air pathway; recontamination risk |
| Mattresses and bedding | Multi-layer foam construction; deep penetration |

**Tier 2: Assess Based on Condition**

| Material | Clean When | Remove When |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| Carpet and pad | Far-Field, Light | Near-Field, Moderate+ |
| Drop ceiling tile | Far-Field, Light, smooth | Near-Field, or textured/acoustic |
| Drywall (painted) | Far-Field, Light | Near-Field Moderate+, or unpainted |
| Upholstered furniture | Far-Field, Light, high value | Near-Field, or low value |

**Tier 3: Generally Cleanable**

| Material | Standard Protocol |
|----------|-------------------|
| Structural steel | HEPA vac → wet wipe → rinse |
| Concrete (sealed) | Scrubber or power wash |
| Metal doors/frames | Wet wipe → rinse |
| Glass/windows | Wet wipe → squeegee |
| Smooth rigid ductwork | Per NADCA ACR |

### 4.5 Ceiling Deck Protocol

Empirical data indicates ceiling deck surfaces require enhanced attention:

**Finding:** 82.4% pass rate for ceiling decks vs 95%+ for other structural surfaces (n=45, QVC dataset)

**Requirements:**
- Increase PRV sample density by 50%
- Consider additional cleaning pass before PRV
- Document access method and cleaning thoroughness
- Priority surface for reclean if failures occur

### 4.6 Secondary Contamination

If fungal/mold growth is identified during fire damage assessment:
- Document presence, type, and extent
- Cross-reference IICRC S520 for remediation protocols
- Address fire damage and biological contamination as separate scopes
- Sequential remediation may be required (mold first if active growth)

---

## Part 5: Cleaning Protocol Framework

### 5.1 Standard Cleaning Sequence

```
Step 1: HEPA Vacuum
        └── Remove loose particulate from all surfaces
        
Step 2: Dry Sponge (if needed)
        └── Chemical sponge for char/soot on non-porous surfaces
        
Step 3: Wet Wipe - Alkaline Detergent
        └── pH 10-12 solution for chemical residue removal
        
Step 4: Rinse Wipe
        └── Clean water to remove detergent residue
        
Step 5: Degreaser (if needed)
        └── For stubborn residues not removed by standard protocol
```

**Sequencing Rule:** Clean top-down (roof deck → structure → walls → floor) to prevent recontamination.

### 5.2 Surface-Specific Methods

| Surface Type | Standard Method |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Steel roof deck | HEPA vac → Wet wipe → Rinse |
| Steel joists/beams | HEPA vac → Wet wipe → Rinse |
| Steel columns | HEPA vac → Wet wipe → Rinse |
| Concrete floor | Scrubber machine + alkaline |
| CMU walls | HEPA vac → Wet wipe OR power wash |
| Metal doors | Wet wipe → Rinse |
| Rigid ductwork | Per NADCA ACR |

### 5.3 Air Filtration Requirements

**Source:** NADCA ACR 2021 Edition, Section 3.6

**Minimum Requirement:** 4 air changes per hour (ACH)

**Calculation:**
```
Units Required = (Volume CF × 4 ACH) / (Unit CFM × 60)

Where:
  Volume CF = Area SF × Ceiling Height FT
  Unit CFM = Rated capacity of air scrubber
```

**Example:**
```
Work Area: 50,000 SF × 30 FT = 1,500,000 CF
Units = (1,500,000 × 4) / (2,000 CFM × 60) = 50 units
```

### 5.4 Reclean/Retest Protocol

When PRV samples exceed clearance thresholds:

**Step 1: Identify Deficient Areas**
- Map failed sample locations
- Determine surface types affected
- Assess pattern (localized vs widespread)

**Step 2: Reclean Specification**
```
Failed surfaces at [SAMPLE LOCATIONS] require additional cleaning:
- [SURFACE TYPE]: Execute [PROTOCOL] with additional pass
- Extend cleaning 10 feet beyond failed sample locations
- Document cleaning date, method, and personnel
```

**Step 3: Retest Protocol**
- Resample at original failed locations
- Add samples at adjacent locations if pattern suggests broader issue
- Same laboratory and analytical methods as original PRV

**Step 4: Documentation**
- Reference original sample numbers and results
- Document reclean activities
- Report retest results with comparison to original

**Iteration:** Repeat until all samples pass clearance thresholds.

## Appendix A: Lab Result Interpretation Framework

### A.1 Supported Laboratory Formats

FDAM supports two primary laboratory reporting formats:

**Format 1: Quantitative (particles/cm²)**
- Labs: Hayes Microbial, EMSL, others
- Direct comparison to FDAM thresholds
- Preferred format for pass/fail determination

**Format 2: Semi-Quantitative (% particles per field at 400x)**
- Labs: N.G. Carlson Analytical, EAA Baxter methodology
- Requires interpretation guidance
- Methodological differences from Format 1

### A.2 Format 1: Quantitative Interpretation

Direct threshold comparison:

| Analyte | Result | Threshold | Determination |
|---------|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Ash/Char | [value]/cm² | < 150/cm² | PASS if < 150 |
| Aciniform Soot | [value]/cm² | < 500/cm² | PASS if < 500 |

### A.3 Format 2: Semi-Quantitative Interpretation

**Source:** EAA Air-O-Cell Method Guide & Particle Atlas (2018); EMSL Fire & Smoke Damage Guide 2021

| % per Field (400x) | Lab Interpretation | FDAM Guidance |
|--------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| < 1% | Typical low | Presumed PASS - consistent with clearance |
| < 3% | Upper background | Presumed PASS - within acceptable range |
| 3-10% | Moderate impact | Professional judgment required |
| > 10% | Significant impact | Presumed FAIL - additional cleaning likely required |

**Methodological Caveat:**
Percentage-per-field and particles/cm² are fundamentally different analytical approaches. The guidance above represents professional correlation, not mathematical conversion. When results fall in the 3-10% range, consider:
- Visual condition at sample location
- Comparison to control samples
- Overall project context
- Retesting with quantitative methodology if determination is critical

### A.4 Decision Logic

```
INPUT: Lab Result + Format + Facility Classification

STEP 1: Identify Format
  IF particles/cm² → Use A.2 direct comparison
  IF % per field → Use A.3 interpretation guidance

STEP 2: Determine Threshold
  Metals → Per Facility Classification (Section 3.1)
  Particulates → Standard thresholds (Section 1.6)

STEP 3: Compare and Determine
  IF Result < Threshold → PASS
  IF Result > Threshold → FAIL
  IF Semi-quantitative in judgment range → Flag for professional review

STEP 4: Document
  Record result, threshold, source, determination
  Flag professional judgment thresholds
```

### A.5 Laboratory Selection Guidance

When selecting laboratories:
- Confirm reporting format before submission
- Request particles/cm² format when available
- Ensure consistent methodology across PRA and PRV sampling
- Request differentiation notes if atypical particles observed

### A.6 Unit Conversion Reference

Laboratories may report surface particle concentrations in different units. Use the following conversions:

**Area Conversions:**
```
1 cm² = 100 mm²
cts/mm² × 100 = cts/cm²
cts/cm² ÷ 100 = cts/mm²
```

**Common Laboratory Unit Formats:**

| Lab Format | Unit | Conversion to FDAM (cts/cm²) |
|------------|------|------------------------------|
| Hayes Microbial | cts/cm² | Direct comparison |
| EAA | cts/mm² | Multiply by 100 |
| N.G. Carlson | % per field | Use Appendix A.3 guidance |

**Example Conversion:**
- EAA reports: 5.0 cts/mm² fire residue
- FDAM equivalent: 5.0 × 100 = 500 cts/cm²
- Threshold comparison: 500 cts/cm² vs <150 (Ash/Char) = FAIL

**EAA Classification to FDAM Threshold Comparison:**

| EAA Classification | EAA (cts/mm²) | Converted (cts/cm²) | FDAM Status |
|--------------------|---------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Low | <1.0 | <100 | PASS |
| Typical-low | 1.0-5.0 | 100-500 | Evaluate vs threshold |
| Low-moderate | 5.0-10 | 500-1,000 | Likely FAIL |
| Moderate | 10-50 | 1,000-5,000 | FAIL |
| High | >50 | >5,000 | FAIL |

FDAM clearance thresholds (150 cts/cm² ash/char, 500 cts/cm² aciniform) fall within or at the upper boundary of EAA's "Typical-low" classification (100-500 cts/cm²), confirming FDAM thresholds are appropriately conservative for post-restoration clearance.

| Beam | 6 | 100% |
| Column | 1 | 100% |
| Pipe | 1 | 100% |

**Finding:** Ceiling decks exhibit significantly lower pass rates, driving the ceiling deck emphasis protocol in Section 4.5.

### B.4 Failed Sample Analysis

| Sample | Location | Aciniform | Ash/Char | Failure |
|--------|----------|-----------|----------|---------|
| 02 | B2-C2 Grid - Ceiling Deck | 2,200/cm² | 4/cm² | Aciniform |
| 06 | D2-E2 Grid - Ceiling Deck | 1,320/cm² | 15/cm² | Aciniform |
| 12 | E3-F3 Grid - CJ Horizontal | 8/cm² | 440/cm² | Ash/Char |

All failures were addressed through reclean/retest protocol and subsequently passed.

### B.5 Laboratory Reference Ranges

**Source:** Hayes Microbial Consulting, based on ASTM D6602

| Particle Type | Normal Surface Range |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Ash/Char | 0-300/cm² |
| Aciniform Soot | 0-800/cm² |
| Cellulose Fibers | 0-1,600/cm² |
| Synthetic Fibers | 0-1,600/cm² |
| Silicates | 0-2,800/cm² |

These ranges represent typical environments, not post-fire clearance criteria. FDAM thresholds are set below these ranges to ensure demonstrably clean post-restoration conditions.

### B.6 Our Lady of Victory Dataset

**Project:** Our Lady of Victory (Catholic School)  
**Location:** Minnesota  
**Date:** February 2025  
**Sample Type:** Assessment  
**Sample Count:** 55 tease-tape samples  
**Laboratory:** N.G. Carlson Analytical  
**Facility Classification:** Public-Childcare

**Methodology:** Semi-quantitative (% particles per field at 400x)

**Distribution by Impact Level:**

| Impact Level | Samples | Percentage |
|--------------|---------|------------|
| No Char/No Soot | 14 | 27% |
| Typical Low (<1%) | 25 | 48% |
| Upper Background (<3%) | 7 | 13% |
| Moderate (3-10%) | 5 | 10% |
| Significant (>10%) | 1 | 2% |

**Pattern Observation:** Basement and lower-level areas showed higher contamination, consistent with smoke stratification.
