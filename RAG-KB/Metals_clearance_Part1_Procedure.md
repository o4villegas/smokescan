# Surface Wipe Sampling for Metals

## 1.0 Purpose & Scope

This document describes a field procedure for taking wipe samples for metals on surfaces. It is based on methodology described in NIOSH 9100 "Lead in Surface Wipe Samples" of the NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods.

The goal of the procedure is to provide a uniform methodology to collect representative samples. Using this method will ensure repeatability between various sampling personnel and between surface configurations. It is used for characterizing surface levels for the following reasons:

- Decommissioning operational areas
- Evaluating the effectiveness of clean-up of a spill
- Evaluating compliance with housekeeping levels in operational areas
- Characterizing a piece of equipment for release.

## 2.0 Responsibilities

**2.1 Demonstrated Competency:** This procedure is administered through persons who have demonstrated competency in performing this procedure in accordance with Section 7 are qualified to use this procedure.

**2.2 Chain of Custody procedures:** The qualified sampler is responsible for samples until they have been properly transferred to the IH Group laboratory using the *IH51200 IH Laboratory Equipment & Sample Processing* procedure.

**2.3 Hazard Analysis of the Sampling Task:** It is the responsibility of persons using this method and their supervisors to:

- Use appropriate personal protective equipment; see section 5.3.
- Obtain required training and qualification for hazards in areas.
- Comply with all work planning and work permit system requirements.

## 3.0 Definitions

**Surface Wipe-** a technique for the determination of metal on surfaces conducted by wiping the loose dust from the surface with a cloth/paper media and analysis of the metal on the media by laboratory or XRF measurement.

Definitions associated with surface wipe criteria are cited in Attachment 9.3

## 4.0 Prerequisites

**Area Access:**

4.1 Training for hazards may be needed for entry into areas with hazards, such as radiological areas..

4.2 Contact the appropriate Facility Support Representative or Technician to obtain approval to enter radiological areas.

4.3 Review and sign the Work Permit or Radiological Work Permit if needed.

4.4 Use appropriate PPE for area.

## 5.0 Precautions

**5.1 Hazard assessment:** Taking surface wipe samples may cause some exposure to health risks. Sampling may be performed in areas with metal, chemical or radiological contamination. These hazards must be assessed on a case-by-case basis by a competent individual knowledgeable of the hazards of the area.

**5.2 Job Risk Assessment:** Consult the Job Risk Assessment SHSD-JRA-05 for the risk analysis of this operation based on the hazards and controls of this SOP.

**5.3 Personal Protective Equipment:** Use appropriate personal protective equipment when implementing this procedure.

- **Hand:** Use gloves in areas of known or suspected metal, chemical or radiological contamination. Exam-style, splash gloves are acceptable. Acceptable polymers are: Nitrile, PVC, and Natural Rubber. The gloves must have sufficient impermeability to the surface contaminant and solvent used on the collection media to allow safe handling. See Table 1.
- **Body:** Use a disposable suit if contact of the body with contaminated surfaces is anticipated. Acceptable chemical protective equipment materials include: Tyvek®, KleenGuard®, and cotton. Contact the ECR for disposable of garments. If personal clothing items become contaminated, they must be surrender for BNL cleaning or disposal.
- **Foot:** Use disposable shoe coverings, boots or booties if contact of the feet with contaminated surfaces is anticipated. Acceptable material include: Tyvek®, KleenGuard®, and rubber. If personal shoes become contaminated, they must be surrendered for BNL cleaning or disposal.
- **Respiratory:** Under normal use, respiratory protection is not required. Use a respirator in an area with the potential to exceed the OSHA, ACGIH, or DOE standards. The person collecting using respiratory protection must comply with the BNL Respiratory Protection Program.
- **Eye:** Use safety glasses with side shields in laboratories, construction, and general industry areas.

**5.4 Radioactive Concerns:** It is possible that some surfaces to be tested may have radioactive contamination. In these cases, personal protective equipment and administrative controls must be implemented for the radiological contaminant hazard.

In addition, the collected sample must be analyzed for the radiological hazard before it can be submitted to the IH Group for analysis. The radiological contamination must be below the permissible release limits to the general public.

**5.5 Work Planning:** All requirements of work permits and work planning system reviews must be met in performing this procedure.

**5.6 Personal Hygiene:** Remove PPE and wash hands after sampling and before eating or drinking.

**5.7 Environmental Impact and Waste Disposal:** This technique does not have adverse impact on the environment. Based on WMD testing of similar PPE material, the templates and gloves can be disposed as normal trash. See Attachment 9.4.

## 6.0 Procedure

### 6.1 Equipment

| | • 1ft2: 1foot x 1 foot, or other shape totaling 144 in2. |

### 6.2. Wipe Technique

BNL SHSD IH Group has selected the NIOSH method of collecting wipe samples. For uniformity, this method should be used for all sampling surface to be sampled (Visually depicted in Figure A)

**Figure A: NIOSH Surface Wipe Method**

[Figure shows three-step wiping process: 1. First Wipe using whole pad in S-pattern, 2. Second Wipe using half pad (folded) in S-pattern at right angles, 3. Third Wipe using quarter pad (folded again) in S-pattern. With each step, fold the exposed surface inward. Final step 4 shows folding to put in bag/bottle with label.]

**6.2.1** Use a moistened sample media or pre-moistened wipe (e.g. GhostWipe™). Apply only enough solvent to moisten approximately 80% of the area of the media. Avoid excess solvent on the filter or pad as it may cause drips and running on the surface thus diluting the sample.

### Table 1

| Contaminant | Media(1) | Solvent(2) | PPE Glove(2) Disposable Style | Sample Size |
|-------------|----------|------------|-------------------------------|-------------|
| **Lead** | Gauze or Filter | 1 -2 ml Distilled Water | Natural Latex Rubber, Nitrile, PVC, or Polyethylene | 1 square foot, 100 cm2 requires advanced approval by IH professional verifying that sensitivity is adequate |
| | Pre-moistened Wipe (should be cut in half) (3) | n/a | | |
| **Beryllium** | Gauze or Filter | 1 - 2 ml Distilled Water Isopropanol, Methanol, Ethanol | Natural Latex Rubber, Nitrile, PVC, or Polyethylene | 1 square foot minimum needed always |
| | Pre-moistened Wipe (should be cut in half) (4) | n/a | | |
| **Arsenic, Cadmium** | Gauze or Filter | 1-2 ml of Distilled Water | Natural Latex Rubber, Nitrile, PVC, or Polyethylene | 100 cm2 typically acceptable |
| | Pre-moistened Wipe (should be cut in half) (4) | n/a | | |
| **Hexavalent Chromium** | Preferred Medias: See Attachment 9.2 | None: For chrome plating operations, see stabilizing solution in Attachment 9.2. | Powderless: Natural Latex Rubber, Nitrile, PVC, or Polyethylene | 100 cm2 typically acceptable |

**Notes for Table 1:**

(1) Some pre-moistened media may not be compatible is certain laboratory analytical equipment. Check with the laboratory analyzing the samples prior to sampling to ensure the brand of media is compatible.

(2) Solvent: The solvent is not critical for lead, beryllium, and most heavy metals such as cadmium, nickel, and chromium. In doing wipes for these compounds, it is allowable to choose the solvent that will have the least impact (residues) on the owner of the equipment being sampled (i.e. some equipment is sensitive to water residues and an alcohol or other solvent may be preferred by the equipment owner.)

(3) Selection criteria: Breakthrough time greater than 1 hour of continuous contact. Source of data is DOE Guidelines for the Selection of Chemical Protective Clothing, 1991.

(4) The use of full size pre-moistened may cause the sample not to meet the minimum level of detection. To increase sensitivity, cut wipe in half to reduce the size of the wipe.

**6.2.2** Place the template over the area to be sampled or measure out 1 ft2 or 100-cm2 surface area, as per Table 1. If the object has a total surface area of less than 1 ft2 or 100 cm2, sample the whole surface area, if possible, and record the surface area. If the surface does not allow the use of a template, carefully determine the dimensions that will equal 1 ft2 or 100 cm2.

**6.2.3** Wipe the surface with firm pressure, using "S" strokes, covering the entire surface (edge to edge). If the surface is very rough (such as concrete), a dabbing action may be substituted for the full contact pressure rubbing of the media across the surface. When dabbing, make sure to completely cover the same area as in the S-stroke wipe. Indicate dabbing done on sample form.

Fold the exposed side of the pad or filter inward (i.e. fold in half).

**6.2.4** Using the once-folded media, wipe the same area S-strokes (see Figure A), starting at right angles to the first wipe. Fold the exposed side of the pad or filter inward.

**6.2.5** Using the twice-folded media, wipe with S-strokes (see Figure A) starting at the original point and wipe in the same direction. Fold the exposed side of the pad or filter in.

**6.2.6** Place the media in a plastic bag or vial. Seal the zip lock or vial. Record the sample identification on the bag or vial.

**6.2.7** Thoroughly clean reusable templates or discard paper templates in preparation of the next sample. Based on WMD testing of similar material, templates can be disposed as normal trash.

**6.2.8** Remove gloves by pulling them off inside-out and discard appropriately before handling the next filter or pad.

**6.2.9** Record the sample identification, surface area sampled, and description of the sample and surface on the sample form (Attachment 9.5) in the electronic SHSD forms page Surface Wipe (Metals)- Field Sampling Records & Chain of Custody.

**6.2.10** Include 1 blank filter or pad (moisten and placed in bags or vials) with each set of samples (provide 1 blank per 6 samples).

### 6.3 Surface Wipe Technique for Hexavalent Chromium

See Attachment 9.2.

### 6.4 Determine HOW MANY samples to take

It is not possible to provide definitive guidance on the number of samples to be taken in every case. Table 2 provides general guidance on which to base professional judgment determining the number of samples. Factors that should be considered in selecting the number of samples include: the size of the area to be tested, the predicted uniformity of contamination over the surface area, and the eventual fate of the surface area (disposal, remediation, background measurement, etc.)

If more than six (6) samples are to be taken, it is suggested that at least one (1) duplicate sample be taken in close proximity to one other to verify the precision (repeatability) of the sampling.

### Table 2: Statistical sampling plan

| Surface Configuration | Minimum Number of Samples | Qualifier |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|-----------|
| Entire Surface is less than 100 cm2 (example: a small article) | 1 | If possible, sample the whole item, one sample is usually sufficient. |
| Surface Area of object or area is greater than 100 cm2 but only a few square feet (example: table top on which a process is done) | 1 | If only one sample is taken, select the area with highest potential contamination |
| Surface Area of object or area is greater than a few square feet (example: floor or wall of a room) | 1 - 3 | Ideally three samples are taken, but fewer samples may be taken depending on the purpose for sampling |
| Multiple surfaces in a large area with the same exposure potential to source (example, many rooms in a building with a common source such as the HVAC system) | 1 – 3 for each surface, 6 or more for the whole area | Assumes all the surfaces have similar exposure potential, else treat each area separately. |

### 6.5 Determine WHAT KIND of samples (LOCATION)

Consider these locations when characterizing levels of surface metals:

- surfaces that are frequently accessed,
- surfaces that hazardous metal object rest on,
- surfaces that are infrequently cleaned or disturbed (such as top of cabinets or high shelves)
- sources of the contamination (such as process equipment, lab apparatus, site of known spills),
- areas where contamination is not expected (these serve as a control), and
- areas where contamination would not be permissible (such as lunch rooms).

### 6.6 Results interpretation

Normalize the units of sampling results from the laboratory to the base units of the Surface Level Criteria Requirements & Recommendations listed in Attachment 9.3.

Conversion of data between various laboratory reporting units of measures: Data can be converted from the various regulatory reporting and laboratory reporting units of measure based on the following values: 1 sq.ft. = 929 cm2 1 mg = 1000 ug

| Convert form: | Multiply by |
|--------------|-------------|
| ug/100 cm2 to ug/sq. ft | 9.29 |
| ug/sq. ft to ug/100 cm2 | 0.1076 |
