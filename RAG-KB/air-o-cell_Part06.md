## CLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES - Average Residential and Commercial Buildings (Concentration/mm²)

### Data collected from horizontal surfaces

| Concentration Classification | Total Spores | Aspergillus/Penicillium | Chronic Water Indicating | Typical Outdoor Fungi | Hyphae Fragments |
|------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Low | <0.1 | <0.1 | <0.1 | <0.1 | <0.1 |
| Typical-low | >0.1 | >0.1 | >0.1 | >0.1 | >0.1 |
| Low-moderate | >1.0 | <10 | >1.0 | >1.0 | >1.0 |
| Moderate | >10 | <20 | >5.0 | >10 | >10 |
| High | >100 | <50 | >10 | >20 | >50 |

### Classification Definitions:

- **Low** - Concentration range found in the average "clean" non-water impacted building
- **Typical-low** - Concentration range found in the average building (minimal history of water leaks or other water events)
- **Low-moderate** - Concentration range found in buildings with inadequate house-keeping and/or possible mold growth
- **Moderate** - Concentration range found in buildings with inadequate house-keeping and/or possible mold growth
- ***High** - Concentration range found in buildings with evidence of significant mold growth*

*\* Some construction lumber & materials may have a natural mold background and may not indicate a current settling or growth condition.*

Historical indoor data collected by EAA is used to classify the results as compared to average "clean" office and residential environments. The concentration classification ranges (regardless of outdoor concentrations) are first used to categorize Aspergillus and Penicillium, and Chronic Water Indicating (W.I.) fungi categories as "High", "Moderate", "Low-moderate", "Typical-low", and "Low". The spore genera distribution can also be used as a possible indication of indoor growth or outdoor air infiltration and subsequent settling. Indoor growth may be indicated when high Aspergillus/Penicillium or Water Indicating spore concentrations are present, or a moderate concentration of hyphae or other types of mold growth structures are present. Occasionally, measuring moderate to high concentrations of Cladosporium, certain basidiospores, or other hyaline fungi may also be indicators of indoor mold growth.

While no classification system used to estimate potential contamination or identify a mold growth source will be applicable to all individual building conditions, EAA's classification ranges are based sample analysis data from our own building inspections, and samples analyzed for other industrial hygiene firms from a wide range of building environments. **These concentration levels should not be used to assess wall cavities or confined spaces.**

# SUGGESTED SURFACE DUST GUIDELINES DEVELOPED BY ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS

## INDOOR SURFACE DUST INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES

*Developed by Environmental Analysis Associates, Inc. - 2003 - 2018*
*Laboratories located in San Diego, California & Bay City, Michigan*
*doc.rev.7 - 7/15/18*

The particle classifications used by EAA (and shown below) provide a concentration ranking of the most common dust contaminants settling on horizontal surfaces inside buildings. These indicator categories provide a direct reflection of dust generated by occupant activity, shedding of building materials, building maintenance, HVAC systems, building furnishings, renovation activities, and/or outdoor infiltration. The concentration ranges and classifications of "High", "Moderate", "Low-moderate", "Typical-low", or "Low" levels cannot directly be used as indicators of safe or unsafe conditions, nor should they be confused with EPA, OSHA, or other governmental exposure guidelines. These guidelines are useful for the comparison of settled dust concentrations in buildings, determining the presence or absence of construction renovation related dust, or to identify other potentially irritant or allergenic particles. The analysis results can also assist maintenance personnel in the determination of the source or origin of indoor air quality complaints, or evaluate the relative cleanliness of content surfaces. The potential association of each particle classification with building related conditions is illustrated in the EAA "Airborne and Surface Dust Analysis Interpretation Guide" on the News and Information page at eaalab.com.

No quantitative assessment criteria are used for the following:

| Category | Assessment |

*\* Reported individually under the "Special Comments Section" - Concentration ranges may vary by type of particle*

### Classification Definitions:

- **Low** - Concentration range found in the average "clean" non-impacted building.
- **Typical-low** - Concentration range found in the average building
- **Low-moderate** - Concentration range found in buildings with inadequate house-keeping
- **Moderate** - Concentration range found in buildings with possible generating sources and/or inadequate filtration
- **High** - Concentration range found in buildings with indoor generating sources and/or significant infiltration

EAA's classification system follows basic guidelines outlined in Chapter 14.2.2 of the ACGIH 1999 document *Bioaerosols: Assessment and Control* by accounting for average baseline data inside buildings. Average levels measured inside buildings without routine HVAC supplied air, or residential dwellings may be higher. No classification system used can be expected to cover all conditions. **These concentration levels should not be used to assess wall cavities or confined spaces.**

*\* Note: All individual particle category values are rounded to 3 decimal places. As a result, individually summed mold categories may be slightly different than the "Total" value. Chronic water indicating fungi (W.I.), include the genera Chaetomium, Stachybotrys, Ulocladium. The hyphae fragments category includes hyphae (mycelia), phialides, perithecia, etc.*

*The qualitative classification ranges for "Low", "Typical-low", "Low-moderate", "Moderate", and "High" should be used for initial comparison purposes only and are based on the average or "typical" concentration ranges found in residential and commercial buildings. The classifications cannot be directly used as an indicator of indoor mold growth, or of a safe or unsafe environment.*
