*\* Wt% guidelines can vary based on particle geometry and background of the carbon substrate.*

*Note: This classification system is designed as a way to generally categorize (classify), and define the gross composition of an individual particle. The "classification" is first assigned based on the visual rank order elemental predominance in the X-ray spectrum. A chi-square classification fit of 65-75% is used. The name given to the "classified" particle is based on the most likely mineralogy found in the natural or indoor environment. The "classification" combinations may not always correctly define the exact composition of a particle, or always correctly represent the rank order quantitative elemental chemistry. Multiple sets of elemental ratio rules are used for "small" verses "large" particles due to increased beam penetration in particles smaller than 5um into the Carbon/Oxygen adhesive substrate. This limitation affects the measured apparent elemental stoichiometry. A 2nd manual review of particle spectra is conducted to verify particle ID.*

*\* The theoretical calculated mass is based on the sum total of each particle volume & theoretical specific gravity.*

*Calculations assume an estimated thickness ratio and should be used as rough comparative mass estimates only.*

*All "classifications" are presumptive, and represent the most likely common mineral classifications present.*

*All calculated values are rounded to 3 significant figures, and should be considered accurate to 2 significant figures.*
