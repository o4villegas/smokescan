## Executive Summary

FDAM is a systematic framework for assessing fire-damaged properties and generating scientifically defensible restoration documentation. The methodology synthesizes regulatory standards, industry guidance, and empirical field data from IHC fire restoration projects.

**FDAM produces three deliverables:**

1. **Cleaning Specification / Scope of Work** — Scope, methods, labor, equipment, and acceptance criteria
2. **Results Interpretation** — Threshold justification, regulatory basis, and pass/fail determination
3. **Executive Summary Report** — Completion verification and compliance documentation

**Standards Basis:**
- Metals clearance: BNL SOP IH75190 (Rev23, 06/23/17)
- Non-Operational alternative: Army/Air Force National Guard Indoor Firing Range Guidelines (200 µg/ft²)
- Air filtration: NADCA ACR 2021 (4 ACH minimum)
- Zone framework: IICRC/RIA/CIRI Technical Guide (December 2025)
- Particulate clearance: IHC professional judgment with empirical validation

## Part 1: Methodology Foundation

### 1.1 Scientific Basis

FDAM synthesizes:

- **Regulatory frameworks:** OSHA Technical Manual, NIOSH sampling methods, EPA clearance standards
- **Industry standards:** IICRC S700/S760, IICRC/RIA/CIRI Technical Guide, NADCA ACR, RIA Fire & Smoke Damage Repair
- **Published guidance:** BNL SOP IH75190, AIHA Technical Guide for Wildfire Impact Assessments
- **Empirical validation:** IHC field data from commercial fire restoration projects (see Appendix B)

### 1.2 Regulatory Framework

| Source | Application | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| BNL SOP IH75190 (Rev23) | Surface wipe clearance for metals | **Primary - verified** |
| Army/Air Force National Guard Guidelines | Non-Operational lead alternative (200 µg/ft²) | **Primary - verified** |
| EPA/HUD Lead Dust Hazard Standards (October 2024) | Public/Childcare lead clearance | **Primary - verified** |
| OSHA Technical Manual, Section II Ch. 2 | Surface contaminant methodology, facility classification | Referenced |
| NIOSH Method 9100 | Surface wipe sampling procedures | Referenced |
| 29 CFR 1910.1025 | Lead housekeeping requirements | Referenced |
| 29 CFR 1910.1018 | Arsenic housekeeping requirements | Referenced |
| 29 CFR 1910.1027 | Cadmium housekeeping requirements | Referenced |
| NADCA ACR 2021 | Air filtration requirements | **Primary - verified** |
| IICRC/RIA/CIRI Technical Guide (Dec 2025) | Zone-based assessment | **Primary - verified** |
| IICRC S520 | Mold remediation (cross-reference for fungal co-occurrence) | Referenced |

### 1.3 Threshold Classification

**Standards-Based Thresholds:** Values from published, peer-reviewed, or regulatory sources with explicit citations.

**Professional Judgment Thresholds:** Values developed through field experience where no published standards exist. Explicitly labeled with empirical validation data where available.

### 1.4 Metals Clearance Thresholds

**Source:** BNL SOP IH75190, Attachment 9.3 (Rev23, 06/23/17)

| Metal | Non-Operational | Operational | Unit | Regulatory Basis |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|------|------------------|
| Lead (Pb) | 22 | 500 | µg/100cm² | 29 CFR 1910.1025 |
| Cadmium (Cd) | 3.3 | 50 | µg/100cm² | 29 CFR 1910.1027 |
| Arsenic (As) | 6.7 | 100 | µg/100cm² | 29 CFR 1910.1018 |

**Unit Conversions:**
- µg/100cm² × 9.29 = µg/ft²
- Lead Non-Op: 22 µg/100cm² ≈ 204 µg/ft²

**Alternative Non-Operational Reference:**
Army and Air Force National Guard "Guidelines and Procedures for Rehabilitation and Conversion of Indoor Firing Ranges" establishes 200 µg/ft² as acceptable surface contamination for spaces converted to general use. This is consistent with BNL Non-Operational threshold (22 µg/100cm² ≈ 204 µg/ft²).

**Public/Childcare Thresholds (EPA/HUD October 2024):**

| Surface | Threshold | Unit |
|---------|-----------|------|
| Floors | 0.54 | µg/100cm² |
| Window Sills | 4.3 | µg/100cm² |
| Window Troughs | 4.3 | µg/100cm² |

### 1.5 Combustion Particle Definitions

Fire/combustion residue particles are classified into three categories based on combustion process:

| Category | Definition | Morphology |
|----------|------------|------------|
| **Soot** | Residues from combustion of organic resins and compounds | Aciniform (grape-like clusters); fine spherical particles; optically opaque |
| **Char** | Incomplete combustion of cellulose/vegetation material | Irregular angular fragments; carbonized plant structure visible; variable size |
| **Ash** | Residual mineral elements remaining after complete combustion (Ca, Na, Mg, K salts) | Irregular crystalline; often white/gray; variable opacity |

Source: Environmental Analysis Associates, Air-O-Cell Method Guide & Particle Atlas (2018)

**Laboratory Reporting Note:** Some laboratories report "Ash and Char" as a combined category. When combined reporting is used, interpret results against the Ash/Char threshold. When separated, sum the values for threshold comparison unless laboratory provides specific guidance.

### 1.6 Particulate Clearance Thresholds

**Classification:** Professional Judgment with Empirical Validation

| Analyte | Clearance Threshold | Unit | Validation Status |
|---------|---------------------|------|-------------------|
| Ash and Char (combined) | < 150 | particles/cm² | Validated (97.8% pass rate, n=45) |
| Aciniform Soot | < 500 | particles/cm² | Validated (91.1% pass rate, n=45) |
| Cellulose/Synthetic Fibers | < 500 | particles/cm² | Professional judgment |
| Silicates | < 1,500 | particles/cm² | Professional judgment |

**Laboratory Reference Comparison:**

| Particle Type | Lab "Normal" Range | FDAM Clearance | Position |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------|----------|
| Ash/Char | 0-300/cm² | < 150/cm² | 50% of upper normal |
| Aciniform Soot | 0-800/cm² | < 500/cm² | 62.5% of upper normal |

Source: Hayes Microbial Consulting, Estimated Normal Ranges based on ASTM D6602

FDAM clearance thresholds are set below laboratory "normal" ranges to ensure post-restoration surfaces are demonstrably cleaner than typical unaffected environments.

**Empirical Validation Summary:**
- Dataset: 45 post-restoration samples (QVC Distribution Center, March 2023)
- Pass rate at current thresholds: 93.3%
- Typical achievable post-cleaning levels: 5-15/cm² (both particle types)
- See Appendix B for complete analysis

**Application:**
- Evaluate in conjunction with visual inspection and odor assessment
- Compare to control/background samples from unaffected areas
- Results interpreted by qualified industrial hygienist

└── Output: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY REPORT
```

### 2.2 Phase 1: Pre-Restoration Evaluation (PRE)

**Field Activities:**

| Activity | Method | Data Captured |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| Site walk-through | Visual inspection | Affected areas, impact severity by zone |
| Odor assessment | Sensory | Presence/intensity/location of smoke odor |
| White wipe test | Clean cloth on surfaces | Preliminary contamination indicator |
| Photo documentation | Camera/device | Conditions, damage, access constraints |
| Material inventory | Visual identification | Surface types, quantities, restorability |
| Dimensional survey | Manual measurement | Room dimensions, surface areas |
| Zone classification | Distance from fire origin | Burn Zone / Near-Field / Far-Field |

**PRE Decision Logic:**

```
IF visible contamination is widespread
   OR odor is significant
   OR white wipe test shows deposits
   OR materials of concern present
   OR property is in Burn Zone or Near-Field Zone
THEN → Recommend PRA (laboratory assessment)

IF contamination is superficial
   AND limited to small area
   AND no materials of concern
   AND Far-Field Zone only
THEN → May proceed directly to cleaning specification
```

### 2.3 Phase 2: Pre-Restoration Assessment (PRA)

**Sampling Protocol:**

*Tape Lift Samples (Particulate Identification):*
- Minimum 1 per distinct surface type per zone
- Additional samples at contamination gradients
- Control samples from unaffected areas (recommended)
- Analysis: Polarized light microscopy (PLM)

*Surface Wipe Samples (Metals Quantification):*
- Per NIOSH Method 9100 / BNL SOP IH75190
- 100 cm² sample area (10cm × 10cm template)
- Ghost Wipes or equivalent pre-moistened media
- Analysis: ICP-MS or ICP-OES at AIHA-accredited laboratory

**Sample Density Guidelines:**

| Area Size | Tape Lifts | Surface Wipes |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| < 5,000 SF | 3-5 per surface type | 3-5 per surface type |
| 5,000 - 25,000 SF | 5-10 per surface type | 5-10 per surface type |
| 25,000 - 100,000 SF | 10-20 per surface type | 10-15 per surface type |
| > 100,000 SF | 20+ per surface type | 15-25 per surface type |

**Ceiling Deck Sample Density (Enhanced):**
Empirical data indicates ceiling deck surfaces exhibit higher post-cleaning contamination rates (82.4% pass rate vs 95%+ for other structural surfaces). For ceiling decks:
- Increase sample density by 50% above standard guidelines
- Minimum 1 sample per 2,500 SF (vs standard 1 per 5,000 SF)

**Qualitative Observation Checklist:**

Document the following at each sample location:

| Observation | Response | Notes |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| Smoke/fire odor present? | Yes / No | Intensity if present |
| Visible soot deposits? | Yes / No | Describe pattern |
| Large char particles observed? | Yes / No | Estimated density |
| Ash-like residue present? | Yes / No | Color, texture |
| Surface discoloration? | Yes / No | Describe |
| Dust loading or interference? | Yes / No | May affect lab accuracy |
| Burned soil/pollen/vegetation indicators? | Yes / No | Wildfire indicator |

This checklist supports visual-to-lab correlation and identifies potential analytical interferences.

### 2.4 Phase 4: Post-Restoration Verification (PRV)

**Verification Protocol:**
1. Visual inspection for dust-free surfaces
2. Odor assessment (no detectable fire/smoke odor)
3. Verification sampling (same methods as PRA)
4. Laboratory analysis
5. Results comparison to clearance criteria
6. Pass/fail determination by area

**PRV Decision Logic:**

```
IF all samples pass clearance thresholds
   AND visual inspection confirms dust-free
   AND no detectable odor
THEN → Issue clearance, generate Executive Summary

IF any samples exceed thresholds
THEN → Execute Reclean/Retest Protocol (Section 5.4)
```
