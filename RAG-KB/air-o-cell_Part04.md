2. Biological / biogenic decay – Decayed skin cells, bio-films, insect droppings, oil residues
3. Corrosion – Degradation of metal HVAC components, pipes, paint, pigments
4. Friction/abrasion – Materials released as result of HVAC component vibration and moving parts
5. Combustion – Burning and heating of biogenic, organic, and other combustible materials

Micrographs of these various types of opaque particles are given on the following pages.

The most common outdoor sources of particles are soil, decayed vegetation, automobile emissions, insect droppings, and fire residue particles.

The most common indoor generated particles include combustion emissions (soot & char), paint, binders from degrading sound liners in HVAC systems, biogenic debris (biological origin, e.g. insect droppings, decayed biological debris, etc.), fan belt rubber particles, oil residue/dust agglomerates, copier toner, and corrosion from HVAC components and metal ducting. Determining the particle chemistry and the generating source usually requires additional analysis by automated Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) / X-ray analysis. The airborne concentration of total "opaque" particles does not normally occur in concentrations exceeding approximately 5,000 cts/m³ in "clean" indoor environments. Identification of the particle origin is not always possible, however, should be investigated as a possible contributor to air quality complaints when airborne concentrations exceed ~10,000 cts/m³.

From a morphological standpoint, biologically derived opaque particles can often be separated from other types of opaque particles. In some cases opaque particles cannot be morphologically differentiated from corrosion shedding particles without using additional analysis by Scanning Electron Microscopy / X-ray or chemical analysis.

# OPAQUE PARTICLES (Primarily biogenic)

## Typical Opaque Particle Concentration Ranges (excluding fire / combustion residue)

| DESCRIPTION | Classification | Surface Cts/mm² | Airborne Cts/m³ |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Inside clean buildings | Low | <10 | <1000 |
| Inside typical buildings | Typical-low | 10 - 20 | 1,000 - 2,000 |
| Low-moderate dust | Low-Moderate | 20 - 50 | 2,000 - 5,000 |
| Moderate | Moderate | 50 - 100 | 5,000 - 10,000 |
| High | High | >100 | >10,000 |

Biogenic opaque black or brown debris are derived from the chemical or biological decomposition of organically derived debris. The most common indoor sources are dander, plant fragments, insect droppings, etc. From a morphological standpoint, biologically derived opaque particles can often be separated from other types of opaque particles. Most biogenic debris have irregular, rounded, and "fuzzy" edge definition and lack the presence of straight particle edges, cleavage planes, or fracture marks. They also have a variability in optical density and will show an irregular variation in color and/or light transmission near the edge and/or throughout the particle. Examples of high levels of airborne biogenic derived debris (i.e. >100,000 cts/m³) are given below:

- Outdoor plant/soil debris & insect droppings
- HVAC duct residue
- Decaying fungal debris
- Floor sweepings from a garage

# OPAQUE PARTICLES (Corrosion & friction)

## Typical Opaque Particle Concentration Ranges

| DESCRIPTION | Classification | Surface Cts/mm² | Airborne Cts/m³ |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Inside clean buildings | Low | <10 | <1000 |
| Inside typical buildings | Typical-low | 10 - 20 | 1,000 - 2,000 |
| Low-moderate dust | Low-Moderate | 20 - 50 | 2,000 - 5,000 |
| Moderate - building shedding possible | Moderate | 50 - 100 | 5,000 - 10,000 |
| High – building shedding likely | High | >100 | >10,000 |

Man-made and opaque corrosion particles are derived from chemical or physical degradation, corrosion, and shedding of mineral or resinous debris. The most common indoor sources are metal corrosion from HVAC system components, or pigment and paint shedding from building surfaces. These types of opaque particles can often be separated from other sources by using a combination of transmitted and reflected light microscopy. Exact identification and quantification may require automated SEM / X-ray analysis.

Most non-biogenic opaque particles have angular and distinct edges, and a low variation in optical density from the edge to the center of the particle in transmitted light illumination. They can often be identified or classified using reflected light (dark field) microscopy (see bottom picture of HVAC corrosion).

### Common Corrosion Particle Types:

- Iron rust particles
- Copier toner
- Tire rubber particles
- HVAC system corrosion particles (Aluminum, Iron, and Zinc oxide particles)

# OPAQUE PARTICLES – WILDFIRE COMBUSTION RESIDUE

## Typical Wildfire / Combustion Particle Concentration Ranges

| DESCRIPTION | Classification | Surface Ratio % | Surface Cts/mm² | Airborne cts/m³ |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Very low / clean | Typical-low | <1% | <1 | <500 |
| Low-Typical | Upper Background | <3% | 1-5 | 500 - 1,000 |
| Moderately elevated | Moderate | 3 - 10% | 10 - 50 | 1,000 - 10,000 |
| High / source present | Elevated | >10% | >50 | >10,000 |

Wildfire combustion particles are a complex mixture of cellulose vegetation, burned soil, residual salts, and crystalline calcium and silica vegetation particles (phytoliths). Quantifying airborne and surface fire combustion contamination is a multi-step process requiring Optical Microscopy (Polarized Light & Reflected Light). Scanning Electron Microscopy / X-ray analysis can be utilized to differentiate look-alike interference particles from actual combustion residue. Wildfire combustion particles can be separated into three basic combustion categories (soot, char, and ash). There are also other indicator particles (e.g. burned soil particles, pollen, plant phytoliths) that can assist in the differentiation of wildfire residues from other types of combustion sources.

### Combustion Categories:

**Soot** – Residues from the combustion of organic resins and compounds

**Char** – Incomplete combustion of cellulose vegetation material

**Ash** – The residual mineral elements remaining after combustion (primarily Calcium, Sodium, Magnesium, and Potassium salts)

### Wildfire Indicators:

- Burned/carbonized mineral grains
- Burned pollen
- Burned plant phytoliths

# INSECT PARTS

## Typical Insect Part Concentration Ranges

| DESCRIPTION | Classification | Surface Cts/mm² | Airborne Cts/m³ |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Inside low background | Typical-low | <0.1 | <50 |
| Inside moderate | Moderate | 0.1 - 10.0 | 50 - 500 |
| Inside high and potential infestation | High | >10.0 | >500 |

Most other recognizable biogenic particles are comprised of whole insects or insect fragments (e.g. body parts, antennae, legs, scales, body hairs, and wing fragments). Bird feather fibrils are occasionally detected as well. In clean indoor environments, insect parts are occasionally detected, however, airborne concentrations above ~100 cts/m³ in air samples are not routinely measured. Elevated concentrations of wings scales, body parts, or insect droppings found in airborne or surface samples may be an indicator of an infestation or inadequate building maintenance and/or air filtration. Occasionally dust mites are also found when inadequate housekeeping, high moisture levels, or extensive mold growth is present. The detection of dust or carpet mites, or parts of other types of organisms in surface or airborne samples may be indicative of an infestation.

### Common Insect-Related Particles:

- Dust & carpet mites
- Moth wing scale
- Insect body hair

# CRYSTALLINE MINERAL DUST PARTICLES – Soil / construction dust

## Typical Crystalline Mineral Particle Concentration Ranges

| DESCRIPTION | Classification | Surface Cts/mm² | Airborne Cts/m³ |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Inside low and clean | Low | <5 | <4,000 |
| Inside low / typical background | Low / typical | 5 - 10 | 4,000 - 10,000 |
| Inside low-moderate dust source | Low-moderate | 10 - 50 | 10,000 - 20,000 |
| Inside moderate dust source | Moderate | 50 - 100 | 20,000 - 100,000 |
| Inside high actively generating source | High | >100 | >100,000 |

Crystalline mineral particles found indoors are generated by two primary sources, 1). Infiltrated and naturally occurring soil particles and, 2). Building construction and finish materials. Construction materials are composed mostly of carbonate and gypsum containing dust generated from the application and renovation of building components, drywall, patching compounds, flooring adhesives, and paint. Infiltrated soil minerals are mostly composed of naturally occurring aluminum silicate clays, quartz, and Calcium carbonates and sulfates. Mineral dust particles are categorized in the analysis as those particles that exhibit low to high birefringence in cross-polarized light.

### Common Crystalline Mineral Types:

- Drywall dust (gypsum) - 750x
- Calcium carbonate - 750x
- Quartz beach sand - dispersion staining - 100x
- Diatomite - 750x
