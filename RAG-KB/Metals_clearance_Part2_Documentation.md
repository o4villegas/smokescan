# Attachment 9.1
## Samples of Signs for Areas and Equipment

---

### CAUTION

**Cadmium Surface Contamination**

Some surfaces in this area have Cadmium levels above BNL Guidelines

- Do NOT perform operations that causes the dust to become airborne (such as using an air hose to clean surfaces or dry sweeping)
- Contact SHSD IH Group x-7475 prior to Building Renovations or Demolition
- Wash hands prior to eating, drinking, chewing gum, or smoking
- Do not eat or drink in this area.

---

### CLEAN

The material on this pallet is below (i.e. cleaner than) the SHSD Best Management Practice Surface Release Guidelines for Lead and Cadmium

It is appropriate to be released and used anywhere at BNL without any specific precautions.

---

### Exceeds Guidelines for Lead or Cadmium

The material on this pallet is above (i.e. not cleaner than) the SHSD Best Management Practice Surface Release Guidelines for Lead and/or Cadmium

Specific precautions are needed in areas where this material is used or stored.

- No operations that cause airborne dust (such as air hoses, blowers, or dry sweeping)
- Wash hands prior to eating, drinking, chewing gums, or smoking.
- Do not eat or drink in this area.
- Notify occupants of the area of the presence of Lead/Cadmium on these surfaces.

# Attachment 9.2
## WIPE SAMPLING TECHNIQUE FOR HEXAVALENT CHROMIUM

**Note:** Hexavalent Chromium has a short life on surfaces. Sampling and analyzed needs to be completed within a few days of generation. For sampling of long term dust accumulations, use Cr3 sampling.

### Materials supplied by the lab:

**Sampling media:**

- For chrome plating: PVC or binderless quartz filter. All other operations:
  - 5 um, 37-mm PVC filter for smooth surfaces
  - 0.45 mm thick 37-or 47-mm binderless quartz fiber filter for rough surfaces (preferred media for both smooth and rough surfaces)
- Immediately after sampling, place the filter sample in a vial containing 10% Na2CO3 with 2% NaHCO3 to stabilize the Cr+6.
- Do not use Ghost wipe®, Whatman, mixed cellulose ester (MCE) or glass fiber filter as they convert Cr+6 to Cr+3.

**Additional materials:**

- Template (10 cm x 10 cm)
- Teflon coated or plastic tweezers
- Empty glass vials
- Glass vials containing 5 ml aqueous solution of 10% Na2CO3 with 2% NaHCO3 for chrome plating samples
- Powderless gloves

### Sampling Technique:

1. Prepare a sufficient number of vials, each labeled with a unique number.

2. Sketch a diagram of the room or area to be sampled.

3. Wear a new pair of clean gloves for each sample. DO NOT use powdered gloves.

4. Record the sample vial number and location where the sample is taken.

5. Remove the filter from the carrying container with a clean PTFE-coated tweezers or plastic tweezers. DO NOT use metal tweezers to handle the filters, as they could deposit Cr+6 onto the filters.

   **Note:** Surfaces should not be wetted with water as the water will allow any metal interference to interact with Cr+6 thereby affecting the results.

6. Use firm pressure when wiping the surface. Start at the one corner moving to the opposite side then upward one wipe width and wipe back to the starting side. Repeat to cover the whole surface area. Fold inward and repeat wiping the entire surface again. Fold in and repeat a third time.

7. After wiping, fold the filter with the contaminant side inward. Place the filter immediately in the sample vial and cap. Filter samples taken in chrome plating operation must be placed in a vial containing 10% Na2CO3 with 2% NaHCO3 to stabilize the Cr+6.

8. Submit at least one blank wipe filter, treated in the same fashion, but without wiping.

9. Sample results will be reported as ug/100cm2. OSHA's target concentration is 0.050ug/100 cm2.

10. Ship samples immediately. If unable to ship immediately, keep cold then ship next day air to the lab.
