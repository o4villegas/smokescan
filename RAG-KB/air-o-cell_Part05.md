# SUGGESTED AIRBORNE MOLD GUIDELINES DEVELOPED BY ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS

## INDOOR AIRBORNE MOLD SPORE INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES

*Developed by Environmental Analysis Associates, Inc. - 2003 - 2018*
*Laboratories located in Bay City, Michigan and San Diego, California*
*doc.rev.3 - 7/15/18*

The indoor air sample interpretation guidelines given below are based on the average mold spore concentration ranges found in typical office and residential environments throughout the country. The classifications are divided into 5 ranges of "High", "Moderate", "Low-moderate", "Typical-low", and "Low", and are based on our 30 years of experience providing mold analysis from a wide range of residential, commercial, office, hospital, and industrial buildings. Exceptions to any guidelines should be expected based upon varied building construction, usage, and HVAC filtration. Site specific exterior climatic conditions can also have a direct impact on the infiltration rate and measured background of mold spores found inside buildings. The presence or absence of vegetation both regionally and in close proximity to a building (e.g. forested, snow covered, or desert / paved urban areas), can directly affect the concentration and distribution of mold spores infiltrating into the building.

## Mold Spore Category Definitions

| Category | Description / Definition |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Total Mold Spores | Total concentration of all enumerated mold spores |
| Aspergillus/Penicillium | Penicillium or Aspergillus morphology (the most common molds associated with indoor growth) |
| Chronic Water Indicating Fungi | Mold genera associated with "chronic" indoor moisture (Stachybotrys, Chaetomium, Ulocladium, Trichoderma) |
| Typical Outdoor Fungi | Mold genera commonly found in outdoor air (Asco/Basidiopores, Cladosporium, and other listed spores) |
| Hyphae Fragments | Mold growth structures including hyphae (mycelia), phialides, perithecia, etc. |

*Note: Cladosporium may commonly grow indoors in sub-tropical climates as well as inside HVAC systems, and on window panes (from condensation). All molds genera listed can be found both indoors and outdoors. Finding low or isolated spores of any genera should be viewed as normal occurrence.*

Importantly, there is no simultaneous short-term relationship between indoor and outdoor mold/fungal spore concentrations. Outdoor airborne concentrations can vary 10-100 fold (e.g. 100-10,000 cts/m³) on an hour-by-hour basis depending on the sampling location, the meteorological conditions at the time of sample collection, the time of day, wind velocity, and seasonal variability. The indoor environment typically has a fewer number of variable conditions and the mold spore concentrations will typically vary no more than 2-5 fold (e.g. 500-2,500 cts/m³) over an entire week. Existing peer reviewed literature clearly states that performing simultaneous indoor/outdoor comparisons using limited data by itself, and without considering both the variability and magnitude of measured concentrations, is scientifically unreliable. One must also consider that the sampling and analysis variability on any individual sample can vary ± 30%. Although indoor spore concentrations are typically lower than the seasonal average for outdoor levels, measuring higher mold spore concentrations indoors (even in the absence of indoor mold growth sources) can be a common and normal occurrence. This is especially true in geographic or climatic locations where minimal exterior vegetation is present. A comparison with outdoor mold spore measurements is often more useful to help determine if the indoor environment is being impacted by outdoor mold spore infiltration from a site specific condition, or historically over an extended period of time. Historical data collected by EAA was used to develop classification ranges for both the concentration and distribution of mold spore genera, and then classify the results as compared to average "clean" indoor environments. Indoor concentration ranges (regardless of outdoor concentrations) are first used to classify the genera of Aspergillus and Penicillium, Chronic Water Indicating Fungi, and Outdoor fungi as "High", "Moderate", "Low-moderate", "Typical-low", and "Low" based on ranges given in the table given below. The Aspergillus/Penicillium and Water Indicating Fungi categories are mold spore genera most commonly associated with the presence of indoor growth. The Outdoor Fungi category (i.e. mold genera commonly found growing on soil and outdoor vegetation) is used to determine if the distribution of mold spores may be the result of outdoor mold spore infiltration. The EAA air sampling results and classification ranges should be used as secondary information to support a thorough visual inspection. A proper assessment of building contamination cannot directly be determined using air sampling results alone. Determining the presence of actual indoor mold growth and if there is an elevated exposure to a moldy environment, requires a thorough visual inspection, visual quantification of the location and extent of surface growth, and documenting the potential routes of exposure.

### Concentration Classification Table

| Concentration Classification | Total Spores | Aspergillus/Penicillium | Chronic Water Indicating | Outdoor Fungi | Hyphae Fragments |
|------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|------------------|
| Low | <500 | <500 | <50 | <200 | <100 |
| Typical-low | >500 | >500 | >50 | >200 | >100 |
| Low-moderate | >1000 | >750 | >100 | >500 | >500 |
| Moderate | >5000 | >1500 | >200 | >1000 | >1000 |
| High | >10000 | >5000 | >500 | >5000 | >2000 |

### Genera Distribution % (Potential Indoor verses Outdoor sources)

| Source Classification | Aspergillus/Penicillium % | Water Indicating ct/m³ | Outdoor Fungi % |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Indoor - low | <20% | < 50 | <20% |
| Indoor - typical | >20% | > 50 | >20% |
| Possible amplification | >50% | > 100 | >50% |
| Indoor amplification | >80% | > 300 | <20% |
| Outdoor infiltration | <20% | <50 | >2,000 cts/m³ |

### Classification Definitions:

- **Low** - Concentration range found in the average "clean" non-water impacted building
- **Typical-low** - Concentration range found in the average building (minimal history of water leaks or other water events)
- **Low-moderate** - Concentration range found in buildings with inadequate house-keeping and/or possible mold growth
- **Moderate** - Concentration range found in buildings with inadequate house-keeping and/or possible mold growth
- **High** - Concentration range found in buildings with evidence of significant mold growth

Although no classification system used to estimate the potential for indoor mold growth, or acceptable indoor spore concentrations can be relied upon in all situations, the Classification Guidelines given above (and supported in principle by published research referenced (below) are based upon the measured variability of spore concentrations and the genera distribution found inside clean and mold contaminated buildings. Although not applicable to all types of building environments, our classification criteria are more reliable than using indoor / outdoor comparisons to assess potential contamination. *The classification guidelines given above cannot be used to assess wall cavities or confined spaces.*

# SUGGESTED AIRBORNE DUST GUIDELINES DEVELOPED BY ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS

## INDOOR AIRBORNE DUST INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES

*Developed by Environmental Analysis Associates, Inc. - 2003 - 2018*

*doc.rev.3 - 7/15/18*

The indoor airborne dust classification categories used by EAA provide a systematic way to measure and evaluate the full range of particles generated by building occupants, renovation and maintenance activities, HVAC corrosion and degradation, and the filtration efficacy of the building. This is accomplished by quantifying and understanding the origin of the most common types of airborne dust particle contaminants. Based on our own historical building inspection observations and analysis data, the measured dust particle concentrations are classified in 5 ranges of "high", "moderate", "low-moderate", "low - typical", and "low". These ranges are not direct indicators of safe or unsafe conditions, nor should they be confused with EPA or OSHA exposure guidelines. The origin and impact of each dust particle category on indoor air quality is described and illustrated in the "Airborne and Surface Dust Analysis Interpretation Guide" provided on the News and Information page of the eaalab.com website. Additional analysis of particle size distribution and inorganic particle chemistry can also be provided by automated SEM / X-ray analysis. The automated SEM/X-ray sampling and analysis methods are also described in the interpretation guide.

## Particle Classification Definitions

| CLASSIFICATION | DESCRIPTION |
|----------------|-------------|
| Pollen | Reproductive spores of flowers |
| Skin cell fragments | Epithelial cells / dander |
| Fiberglass | Man-made fibrous glass fibers (fiberglass, mineral wool) |
| Cellulose / Synthetic | Cellulosic, fabric, synthetic fibers (nylon, rayon, etc.) |
| Unidentified Opaque | Opaque debris (biological decay, tire rubber, corrosion, paint, etc.) |
| Soil / Mineral | Soil, crystalline minerals, construction dust particles |
| Fire residue | Combustion soot, ash, char, other assemblage indicator particles |
| * Other | Specific unusual and atypical particles |
| | *Examples: Copier toner, paint flakes, unusual fibers, feather fibrils, starch grains, etc.* |
| | *To be handled on a case-by-case basis* |

No quantitative assessment criteria are used for the following:

| Category | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| Insect parts | *Concentration range similar to cellulose range* |
| Algae/Fern spores | *Concentration range similar to cellulose range* |

| High | >150 | >20000 | >100 | >1500 | >10000 | >100000 | >10000 | > 1500 |

*\* Reported individually under the "Special Comments Section" - Concentration ranges may vary by type of particle*

### Classification Definitions:

- **Low** - Concentration range found in the average "clean" non-impacted building.
- **Typical - low** - Concentration range found in the average building
- **Low-moderate** - Concentration range found in buildings with infrequent cleaning or high occupancy
- **Moderate** - Concentration range found in buildings with possible generating sources, infrequent cleaning, and/or inadequate filtration
- **High** - Concentration range found in buildings with indoor generating sources and/or significant infiltration

*Note: Pollen level assessment criteria are based on the prevalence of pollen encountered by EAA in indoor environments and not by the general assessment criterion published by the National Allergy Bureau for outdoor airborne levels.*

Although no classification system used to estimate potential contamination can cover all conditions, EAA's system follows industry accepted scientific guidelines outlined in Chapter 14.2.2 of the ACGIH 1999 document *Bioaerosols: Assessment and Control* for the comparison of indoor and outdoor data. Average levels measured inside buildings with very high occupant activity (auditoriums, classrooms, etc.), operations involving industrial activities, or buildings without routine HVAC supplied air will likely have significantly higher average ranges than indicated in the table above. These guidelines are not applicable for the evaluation of wall cavities, attics, crawl spaces, or other confined spaces.

# SUGGESTED SURFACE MOLD GUIDELINES DEVELOPED BY ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS

## INDOOR SURFACE MOLD SPORE INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES

*Developed by Environmental Analysis Associates, Inc. - 2003 - 2018*
*Laboratories located in San Diego, California & Bay City, Michigan*
*doc.rev.7 - 7/15/18*

The surface mold interpretation guidelines given below are based on 30 years experience collecting and analyzing samples from a wide range of building environments. The classification ranges were developed based on data collected from known "clean" residential and commercial buildings, and buildings with a history of water damage and/or mold growth. Exceptions to any guidelines should always be anticipated, especially in locations or climatic conditions where a very high or very low density of vegetation is present.

## Category Definitions

| Category | Description / Definition |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Total Spores | Total concentration of all enumerated spores |
| Aspergillus/Penicillium | Spores with Penicillium or Aspergillus morphology |
| Chronic water indicating fungi | Spores indicating "chronic" moisture (Stachybotrys, Chaetomium, Ulocladium, Trichoderma) |
| Typical Outdoor Fungi | Spores commonly found in outdoor air (Asco/Basidiopores, Cladosporium, Other) |
| Hyphae Fragments | Fungal growth structures including hyphae (mycelia), phialides, perithecia, etc. |

*Note: Cladosporium may commonly grow indoors in sub-tropical climates as well as inside HVAC systems, and with condensation on window panes.*

There is no direct relationship between indoor and outdoor surface mold spore concentrations, and existing peer reviewed mold concentration literature typically refers to indoor/outdoor comparisons of air samples. Very little published literature is available for surface mold spore concentrations. Based on our own experience, the variability and magnitude of measured settled surface concentrations can naturally vary 10,000-fold from less than 0.1 spores/mm² to over 1,000 spores/mm² depending upon environmental factors, location, and the frequency of surface cleaning. When surface "growth" is present, the measured spore and growth "structure" concentrations (e.g. mycelia, arthroconidia, phialides, perithecia, etc.) can range from 100 fungal structures/mm² to over 100,000 fungal structures/mm². When high concentrations of fungal structures and/or spores are measured from a discolored surface of suspect mold growth, the results simply indicate the presence of mold growth. Furthermore, there is no correlation or direct relationship to how much surface area is impacted, nor can the results be used to determine if an airborne hazard is present. Analysis results (by themselves) simply indicate the presence or absence of surface mold growth and/or the concentration of settled spores. Construction lumber and building materials can inherently contain moderate to high surface mold growth structures as purchased from the store or lumberyard. As a result, care must be exercised when interpreting the data collected from lumber, wood products, or other materials stored outdoors prior to being used inside the building. Moderate or high mold concentrations may indicate a pre-existing condition, and not necessarily mold growth or excessive settling that occurred after the material was brought inside the building being tested. Determining the extent of actual indoor mold growth, or an elevated exposure to a moldy environment, requires a thorough visual inspection, visual quantification of the location and extent of surface growth, and evaluation of other environmental factors.
