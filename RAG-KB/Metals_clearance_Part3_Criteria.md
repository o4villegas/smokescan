### Definition (for purposes of the table above):

**AFAP:** As Free As Practicable; Housekeeping- All surfaces shall be maintained as free as practicable of accumulations of [OSHA Regulated Substances]: Arsenic: 1910.1018(k); Cadmium: 1910.1027(k); Chromium: 1910.1026(j); Lead: 1910.1025(h); Acrylonitrile: 1910.1045(k) DBCP: 1910.1044(k); MDA: 1910.1050(l).

The enumerated guidance criteria level is based on: OSHA Technical Manual; Section II: Chapter 2 Surface Contaminants, Skin Exposure, Biological Monitoring and Other Analyses; III. Wipe Sampling, Field Portable X-Ray Fluorescence Sampling, Dermal Sampling and Biological Monitoring; A. Surface Wipe Sampling.

**Accessible surfaces:** Surfaces that can reasonably be expected to be contacted during typical operations. This would include table tops, desks tops, and other surfaces where contact with hands, arms and body are likely. [BNL]

**Eating & Food Prep Surfaces** = Surfaces on which food preparation, eating & drinking are done. This includes lunchroom counters/tables; kitchen counter tops, stove tops; water cooler surfaces; and tables/desks in offices/conference rooms where food and beverage consumption is permitted. [BNL]

**Equipment Release to Operational Area [Beryllium]** = Maximum removable contamination on equipment that is being released to a facility using the beryllium. Equipment must be labeled and sealed in impermeable bag or container. [DOE 10CFR850.31]

**Equipment Release to Operational Area [OSHA Regulated Substance]** = Maximum removable contamination on equipment that is being released to a facility using the regulated substance. [BNL]

**Equipment Release to Non-Operational Area or Public [Beryllium]** = Maximum removable contamination on equipment that is being released to the general public or to a non-beryllium area of a DOE facility. Equipment release is conditioned on the recipient's commitment to implement controls that will prevent foreseeable beryllium exposure, considering the nature of the equipment or item and its future use and the nature of the beryllium contamination. [DOE 10CFR850.31]

**Equipment Release to Non-Operational Area or Public [OSHA Regulated Substance]** = Maximum removable contamination on equipment that is being released to the general public or to a Non-Operational Area. [BNL]

**Housekeeping** = Maximum level allowed on accessible surfaces in Operational Areas during Non-Operational periods. Surfaces contaminated with dusts and waste must not exceed a removable contamination level criterion during Non-Operational periods. This sampling would not include the interior of installed closed systems such as enclosures, glove boxes, chambers, or ventilation systems. [DOE 10CFR850.30]

**Non-Beryllium Area** = Area where beryllium is not used in a DOE facility. [DOE 10CFR 850.31]

**Non-Operational Area [Beryllium]** = Area where beryllium is not used and where workers are not trained in hazards and controls. Personal hygiene control practices are not in place (hand washing is not expected on exiting the area) and eating & drinking are permitted. [BNL]

**Non-Operational Area [OSHA Regulated Substance]** = Area where an OSHA Regulated Substance is not used and where workers are not trained in hazards and controls. Personal hygiene control practices are not in place (hand washing is not expected on exiting the area) and eating & drinking are permitted. [BNL]

**Operational Area [Beryllium]** = Area where workers are routinely in the presence of beryllium as part of their work activity. [DOE 10CFR850.3]

**Operational Area [OSHA Regulated Substance]** = Area where workers are routinely in the presence of an OSHA Regulated Substance as part of their work activity. Workers who handle the substance have been trained in hazards and controls. Substances are routinely used, handled or stored and personal hygiene control practices are in place (e.g. eating, drinking are prohibited in the area; hand washing is expected on exiting the area). Examples: lead shielding blocks, shops, and accelerator areas using organic and inorganic metallic compounds. [BNL]

[OSHA]

**Public** = Persons who are not: DOE employees, BSA employees, contractors, sub-contractors, and persons with Student, Intern, User or Guest appointments. The public includes visitors and family members living in residence at Upton. They are not trained by BNL in hazards and controls of toxic substances. [BNL]

**Public/ Lodging/Childcare Areas** = Area open to the public for periods longer than short visits or tours or areas intended for frequent access by visitors and/or family members. Eating and drinking is allowed in public areas. Occupants are not trained in the hazards of the metal or control measures. Hand washing is not expected on exit of the area. Public areas include: Science Museum (935), Coin Laundry (363), Berkner Hall (388), Swimming Pool (462), Gymnasium (461), Brookhaven Center (30), Research Support Building (400), BNL Upton on-site housing: Cavendish (153), Compton (170), Curie (258), Fleming (180), Guest House (257), Danish House (388), Apartments, Efficiencies; and areas with high occupancy by children: Child Development Center (370), Recreation Hall (317), School House (373) [BNL]

**Regulated Area [Beryllium]** = Area demarcated by the responsible employer in which the airborne concentration of beryllium exceeds, or can reasonably be expected to exceed, the action level. [DOE 10CFR850.3]

**Regulated Area [OSHA Regulated Substance]** = Area where an OSHA Regulated Substance is used in a manner that airborne exposure levels exceed the Permissible Exposure Limit. Area is formally demarcated and access to the area is controlled to those meeting the entry requirements in the OSHA regulation. Personal hygiene control practices are in place; eating and drinking are prohibited; hand washing is expected on exiting the area. OSHA standards require these areas to be "As Free As Practicable". The OSHA Technical Manual (G1) provides a recommended method to enumerate AFAP [BNL]

# IH 75190 Attachment 9.4
## Environmental Evaluation of Surface Wipe Sampling for Chemicals/Metals

**Operation Description:** Field samples for potential metals or chemicals are collected on pre-moistened pads. This process concentrates toxic substances on the media. The wipes are either sent off-site for analysis or in some instances are analyzed at BNL by the IH Group using direct reading meters.

**Frequency of Operation:** 10 to 20 times per year.

**Environmental impact:**

- The wipes sampled at BNL are consumed in the analysis at the end of test by the off-site lab. Conformance with proper wipe disposal by the off-site vendor laboratory is validated to BNL IH Group's satisfaction in the AHIA Accreditation process.
- PPE used during sampling and the paper templates are disposed of at the direction of the EPD ECR. The current policy is for disposal as non-hazardous waste. This is justified because the concentration is too low to be of concern (a few micrograms per wipe surface).

**Waste Disposal:**

- PPE and paper templates are disposed of as non-hazardous waste, unless otherwise directed by EPD.
