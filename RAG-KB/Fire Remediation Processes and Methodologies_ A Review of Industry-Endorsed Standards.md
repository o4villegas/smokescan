# Fire Remediation Processes and Methodologies: A Review of Industry-Endorsed Standards

**Author:** Manus AI
**Date:** January 8, 2026

## 1. Introduction

This report provides a comprehensive overview of industry-endorsed and published sources of domain knowledge for fire remediation processes and methodologies. The research project focused on identifying key standards, guidelines, and technical publications from major standards organizations, government agencies, and industry associations. The findings are intended to serve as a foundational resource for professionals in the fire restoration, insurance, and environmental health and safety sectors.

The fire and smoke damage restoration industry relies on a robust framework of standards and best practices to ensure that remediation work is performed safely, effectively, and in a scientifically defensible manner. This report synthesizes information from a wide range of sources, including the Institute of Inspection, Cleaning and Restoration Certification (IICRC), the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), ASTM International, the Restoration Industry Association (RIA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).

## 2. Key Standards and Guidelines

The following sections detail the most relevant standards and guidelines from leading organizations in the field of fire and smoke damage restoration.

### 2.1. Institute of Inspection, Cleaning and Restoration Certification (IICRC)

The IICRC is a key standards-setting body for the restoration industry. Its standards are ANSI-accredited and internationally recognized as best practices.

**ANSI/IICRC S700: Standard for Professional Fire and Smoke Damage Restoration** [1]

This is the cornerstone standard for the fire and smoke damage restoration industry. It provides a comprehensive framework for the assessment and remediation of fire and smoke damage in buildings. The S700 standard covers the principles, processes, and procedures for assessing fire residues and odors, and for the cleaning and restoration of building systems, structures, and contents. It is important to note that the S700 standard is currently under revision, with a new version expected in the near future.

**ANSI/IICRC S590: Standard for Professional Assessment of HVAC Systems Following a Water, Fire, or Mold Damage Event** [2]

This standard focuses specifically on the assessment of HVAC systems after a fire or other damaging event. It provides detailed procedures for inspecting and evaluating HVAC systems to determine the extent of damage and to develop a restoration plan. The S590 standard is critical for ensuring that HVAC systems are properly cleaned and decontaminated to prevent the spread of contaminants throughout a building.

**IICRC/RIA/CIRI Technical Guide for Wildfire Restoration** [3]

Published in December 2025, this technical guide provides a science-based framework for the restoration of properties impacted by wildfires. It was developed in collaboration with the Restoration Industry Association (RIA) and the Cleaning Industry Research Institute (CIRI). The guide outlines a four-step process for wildfire restoration, including pre-restoration evaluation, pre-restoration assessment, the restoration phase, and project completion.

### 2.2. National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)

The NFPA is a global nonprofit organization devoted to eliminating death, injury, property, and economic loss due to fire, electrical, and related hazards. The NFPA develops and publishes more than 300 consensus codes and standards intended to minimize the risk and effects of fire.

**NFPA 921: Guide for Fire and Explosion Investigations** [4]

NFPA 921 is the primary guide for the scientific investigation of fire and explosion incidents. It establishes a systematic, scientific method for fire investigation that is widely accepted in the legal and insurance communities. The guide provides detailed information on fire dynamics, evidence collection and preservation, and the analysis of fire patterns.

**NFPA 1033: Standard for Professional Qualifications for Fire Investigator** [5]

This standard establishes the minimum job performance requirements for fire investigators. It is a critical standard for ensuring that fire investigations are conducted by qualified professionals with the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities.

### 2.3. ASTM International

ASTM International is a globally recognized leader in the development and delivery of voluntary consensus standards. ASTM standards are used around the world to improve product quality, enhance health and safety, strengthen market access and trade, and build consumer confidence.

**ASTM E119: Standard Test Methods for Fire Tests of Building Construction and Materials** [6]

This standard is used to evaluate the fire-resistance of building materials and assemblies. It provides a standardized method for testing how long building elements can withstand a fire and continue to perform their structural function.

**ASTM C856: Standard Practice for Petrographic Examination of Hardened Concrete** [7]

This standard is used to assess the condition of concrete after a fire. It provides a method for examining the microstructure of concrete to determine the extent of damage and to guide repair and restoration efforts.

## 3. Government Agencies

Government agencies such as the EPA and OSHA also play a role in the fire restoration industry by providing guidelines and regulations related to environmental protection and worker safety.

### 3.1. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

The EPA provides guidance on the cleanup of hazardous materials after a fire, as well as on the management of debris and waste from fire-damaged buildings. The EPA's guidelines are designed to protect human health and the environment from the potential hazards associated with fire and smoke damage.

### 3.2. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)

OSHA sets and enforces standards to ensure safe and healthful working conditions for working men and women. OSHA's regulations cover a wide range of workplace hazards, including those associated with fire and smoke damage restoration. These regulations include requirements for personal protective equipment (PPE), respiratory protection, and hazard communication.

## 4. Conclusion

The fire remediation industry is governed by a complex and evolving set of standards, guidelines, and best practices. This report has provided an overview of the key organizations and documents that shape the industry. It is essential for professionals in the field to stay current with these standards to ensure that they are providing the highest quality of service to their clients and to protect the health and safety of workers and the public.
