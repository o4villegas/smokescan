*The "Estimated Area Ratio %" is the numerical "size/area adjusted" ratio between all particle categories based on the average estimated area of each particle category.*

*The "Surface density (Cts/mm2)" of fire residue particles is the numerical surface particle concentration independent of the amount or ratio of background dust.*

*\* Note: If the surface density of fire residue particles (cts/mm2) is not displayed, it was not analyzed due to significant sample overloading, or calculated on tape lift samples that are not "overloaded" with dust, or on filter samples collected from a known surface area and calculated serial dilution.*

*\* The summary guidelines for "Low", "upper background "Upper Bkg.", "Moderate", and "High" concentrations are based on the variance of quantitative background levels (area ratio% and cts/mm2) measured by EAA in buildings. The local geographic background, site specific conditions, and other potential combustion sources must be taken into account in order to determine if an elevated or atypical fire/combustion residue condition is present.*

### Fire / Combustion Residue Concentrations For Buildings

| Ratio % & Surface Concentrations | Classification Range | Total Fire Residue (ratio%) | Total Fire Residue (ct/mm2) |
|----------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| | Low | <1% | <1 |
| | Upper Bkg. | 1-3% | 1-5 |
| | Moderate | 3-10% | 5-50 |
| | High | >10% | >50 |

### FIRE/COMBUSTION RESIDUE & DUST ANALYSIS - Optical Microscopy

**Method: FIRE-D02**
**Data page 2 of 12**

**Client Name:** ABC Environmental
**Client Project #:** 18-1050
**Requested by:** Mr. John Smith
**Project Description:** Office building
**Client Sample #:** T2
**Client sample description:** Source- I Beam-2
**Sample collected:** 7/10/18
**Sample received:** 7/11/18
**Sample media:** tape

**EAA Project #:** 18-0066
**EAA Sample #:** T2

### SUMMARY CONCLUSIONS:

* Fire/combustion residue concentration measured above typical background concentrations
* Qualitative observations indicate the potential presence of fire/combustion particles
* Interferences present - Results may be higher or lower than reported

### QUALITATIVE ASSEMBLAGE OBSERVATIONS - Reflected Light Microscopy (10-200x) / Polarized Light (100-600x)

| Observation | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| Lab sample description (color /texture) | Isolated areas of black powdery dust |
| Is a smoke or fire odor present? | No |
| Are large char particles observed in reflected or polarized light? | Yes |
| Are large ash-like particles observed in reflected or polarized light? | No |
| Are "burned" soil particles, pollen, or plant phytoliths observed? | No |
