*\* The SUMMARY CONCLUSIONS describing fire/combustion residue concentrations are based on both the "qualitative indicators" present, and the variance of "quantitative" background levels measured by EAA in typical buildings. The local geographic background, site specific conditions, and other potential combustion sources must be taken into account in order to determine if an elevated or atypical condition is present. The estimated surface particle concentrations per unit surface area (Cts/mm2) can only be calculated on surface tape lift samples.*

# AUTOMATED SEM / X-RAY DUST ANALYSIS PROCEDURES

## Specialized testing offered by Environmental Analysis Associates

Environmental Analysis Associates, Inc. operates two laboratory facilities located in Bay City, Michigan, and San Diego, California. Both facilities are equipped with automated Scanning Electron Microscopes and specialized X-ray particle analysis software specifically designed to identify the source and cause of the indoor air quality complaints.

The data collected by the SEM and EDAX™ "Particle™" X-ray software is converted into a statistical report format developed by EAA. The analysis reports provide particle size distribution and elemental chemistry analysis designed for use by environmental health professionals. The reports provide direct estimates of quantitative sample chemistry, mass and size distribution, including mass estimates of respirable and inhalable sized dust (e.g. PM2.5 and PM10).

## SAMPLE COLLECTION METHODS

Different types of sample collection media can be used depending on the type of sample being analyzed. Bulk, vacuum, or adhesive tape lift media can be used to collect surface dust samples. The direct preparation of adhesive tape media is the preferred procedure to evaluate settled dust samples. Water samples can be filtered using 0.4µm polycarbonate filter media. Airborne samples can be collected using polycarbonate filters or Zefon™ Air-O-Cell CSI™ slit impaction samplers that contain adhesive media compatible with the SEM and Dispersive X-ray analysis.

## ANALYSIS METHOD SUMMARY

The SEM analysis method is utilized as a semi-quantitative diagnostic testing procedure to estimate the size and Elemental distribution of individual particles within a surface dust, airborne dust, or water sample. The method is well-suited to simultaneously provide gravimetric mass measurements when chemistry information cannot be collected by using conventional methods. Optical Microscopy methods are recommended for the analysis of biological fibers and particles (mold, pollen, etc.) and not SEM analysis. A flow diagram for the suggested use this method is given on page 4 of this document.

# AUTOMATED SEM/X-RAY DUST ANALYSIS PROCEDURES

## Table of the most common sources and classification of indoor inorganic dust particles

The following are the most common examples of how materials are classified in the automated SEM report:

| Material Description | Naturally Occurring? | Building Source/Composition | Common X-ray Classifications |
|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Common Building Components** | | | |
| Carbonaceous | Y - common | Biological synthetic particles fibers | M carbon ** |
| Asphaltic | N | Roofing / patching | S carbon |
| Quartz | Y - common | Concrete, sand, plasters | Quartz-like, Si oxide |
| Mixed silicate clays | Y - common | Soil infiltration, plasters, insulation | M Al silicate ** |
| Vermiculite | N | Spray on insulation (variable) | M Al silicate (special)** |
| Calcium sulfate | Y - rare | Drywall board / compounds | Ca sulfate |
| Calcium carbonate | Y - low | Concrete, patching compounds | Ca carbonate |
| Calcium silicate | Y - low | Concrete, patching compound, plasters | Ca silicate |
| Magnesium silicate | N | Concrete, patching compound, plasters | Mg silicate |
| Calcium / Magnesium silicate | N | Concrete, patching compound, plasters | MgCa silicate |
| Titanium Paints | N | Coatings - Wall, ceiling tiles, etc | M Ti oxide ** |
| **Corrosion Particles** | | | |
| Iron oxide | Y - moderate | Pipes, motors, HVAC components | Fe oxide |
| Al oxide | Y - moderate | HVAC, ducting, brackets, windows | Al oxide |
| Zn oxide | N | Galvanized HVAC coatings | Zn oxide |
| AlZn oxide | N | HVAC ducting / components | AlZn oxide |
| Mixed Aluminum/Iron oxide | N | HVAC components / drip pans | AlFe oxide |
| Mixed Aluminum/Iron/Copper oxide | N | Mixed HVAC components | AlFeCu oxide |
| Mixed Iron/Chromium Oxide | N | Steel corrosion particles | CrFe oxide |
| Cu oxide | N | Copper piping | Cu oxide |
| **Combustion Residue Particles** | | | |
| Soot / char particles | Y | Heated carbonaceous components | H carbon |
| Vegetation ash | Y | Residual mineral salts–combustion | Ca,Mg,K oxides |
| Plant phytoliths | Y | Outdoor infiltration – vegetation | Ca, Si oxides |

It is important to note that most materials are not "pure" and minor amounts (1-5%) of other common elements are usually found in association with each classification.

*\* The particle minor element chemistry and morphology occasionally needs to be considered to classify the particles appropriately*

*\*\* An "M" prefix refers to "mixed" element classification (e.g. M carbon for mixed carbon)*
