## Purpose and Scope

This technical guide presents current and common methodology of prudent wildfire restoration practices. It represents thousands of restoration companies and professionals who have returned families to their homes safely using proven, science-based methodologies in accordance with peer-reviewed industry standards.

## Key Message

The guide addresses a growing unfounded sentiment that homes affected by wildfire smoke and its byproducts are categorically uncleanable and unrestorable. The guide emphasizes that:
- Wildfire smoke damage is a superficial occurrence that can generally be cleaned
- Specialized cleaning methodologies have been successfully used for decades
- Professional restoration is science-based and proven
- Categorical disposal of all materials and structures is inconsistent with science and industry standards

## Four Core Procedural Principles

### 1. Pre-Restoration Evaluation (PRE)
- Critical first step performed by the restorer
- Establishes degree of impact from wildfire event
- Goal: identify presence of wildfire-related combustion byproducts through visual and sensory inspection
- Identifies key risk factors
- Determines whether restoration can begin immediately or if formal assessment is needed

### 2. Pre-Restoration Assessment (PRA)
- Formal, third-party process
- Typically performed by Industrial Hygienist (IH) or qualified OEHS professional
- Triggered by specific findings in PRE, stakeholder request, or AHJ requirements
- Uses scientific sampling and laboratory analysis
- Definitively characterizes type and extent of combustion byproducts
- Establishes data-driven, defensible scope of work

### 3. The Restoration Phase
- Physical process of removing wildfire-related combustion byproducts
- Goal: return structure, systems, and contents to clean, safe, odor-free condition
- Includes detailed source-removal cleaning
- Indoor air quality management
- Proper documentation and disposal of non-salvageable items

### 4. Project Completion
- Final critical phase
- Establishes success of restoration efforts
- Collects evidence that combustion byproducts have been effectively removed
- Two components:
  - **Restoration Completion Evaluation (RCE)**: conducted by restorer
  - **Post Restoration Verification (PRV)**: performed by independent third party when necessary

## Key Terminology

**Combustion By-Products (CBP):** Resulting substances (char, ash, smoke) created from a fire event

**Combustion Byproducts of Concern (CBC):** Wildfire-related combustion byproducts that can pose potential for continued damage or elevated human health risks

**Burn Zone:** Wildfire impact zone with direct flame impingement or significant radiant heat

**Near-Field Zone:** Extends from fire perimeter to approximately 1-10 kilometers (0.6 to 6.2 miles); affected by hot, turbulent smoke plume forcing particulates and gaseous combustion byproducts (VOCs) into building envelope

**Far-Field Zone:** Extends beyond Near-Field Zone, potentially for hundreds of miles; primary impact is infiltration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5); impact is often surface-level and highly correctable

## Document Structure

The guide includes:
- Introduction
- Combustion Byproducts of Concern (CBC)
- Impact Zones
- Pre-Restoration Evaluation and Assessment
- The Restoration Phase (health/safety, procedures, removal of unrestorable goods)
- Project Completion
- Glossary of Terms
- References
