| Inside "clean" | Very low | ND - 0.1 | ND |
| Inside (low / typical) | Low | 0.1 - 0.3 | <30 |
| Inside (moderate) - Infiltration | Moderate | 0.3 - 1.0 | 30 - 100 |
| Inside (high) – Significant infiltration | High | >1.0 | > 100 |

*Note: All concentrations refer to measurements obtained during the growing seasons reflecting local California data. Other geographic regions could be higher or lower than the approximate ranges given above.*

The presence of pollen or fern spores in the indoor environment is almost always the result of air infiltration from the outdoor environment. In a typical HVAC air supplied building, airborne pollen concentrations will be very low (less than 10ct/m³) or not detected at all. Sensitive individuals can mistakenly attribute complaints to the interior of a building that are actually the result of exterior infiltration or other allergen sources. Landscaping in building courtyards can also be a factor with perceived indoor problems. The time of year, the home environment, and pathway to work, may also be significant sources for potential exposure.

According to the literature, the individual allergy response to pollen exposure is highly variable. Some individuals with pollen allergies may begin to exhibit symptoms when airborne concentrations exceed approximately 50 cts/m³, especially with grass or highly allergenic pollen such as ragweed. Outdoor airborne levels can range from not detected to over 1,000 cts/m³ depending on the geographic location, local vegetation, and season. The time of day when symptoms are pronounced is extremely critical for proper source diagnosis. Because of the wide range and severity of individual pollen allergenicity, consultation with an Allergist may be warranted in the rare occasions where elevated indoor pollen concentrations have been measured.

Pollen identification in the EAA analysis report is given as the genus when known, or as the taxonomic classification (e.g. inaperturate, triporate, tricolpate, etc.) when the pollen cannot be readily identified. Detailed analysis of pollen species within our reports is only provided upon special request.

### Common Pollen Types:

# ALGAE & BIO-FILM ORGANISMS

## Typical Algae and Other Bio-film Organism Concentration Ranges

| DESCRIPTION | Classification | Cts/mm² | Cts/m³ |
|-------------|----------------|---------|--------|
| Outside | Wide range | Not applicable | 10 - 1,000 |
| Inside | Low | ND - 0.1 | ND - 50 |
| Inside | Moderate | 0.1 - 0.5 | 50 - 200 |
| Inside | High | >0.5 | > 200 |

When algae, bio-film deposits, protozoan organisms, etc. are detected in any concentration in indoor samples, a stagnant water source is likely present somewhere in proximity to the air intake stream, or there are other potential nearby water reservoirs. Although significant information is not readily available regarding health effects, algae and bio-film organisms are potential indicators of persistent moisture and other potential bacteriological or protozoa reservoirs.

# SKIN CELL FRAGMENTS – (DANDER)

## Typical Skin Cell Fragment Concentration Ranges

| DESCRIPTION | Classification | Surface Cts/mm² | Airborne Cts/m³ |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Outside | Low | <0.1 | 50 - 1,000 |
| Inside air clean buildings | Low | 0.1 - 10.0 | 1,000 - 10,000 |
| Inside air high activity | Moderate | 10.0 - 100 | 10,000 - 20,000 |
| High activity / poor housekeeping | High | >100 | 20,000 - 100,000 |

Dander or skin cell fragments are the most common source of particle debris in indoor samples. The skin cell fragment category includes particle concentrations greater than ~20um in diameter. One of the biggest differences between inside and outside air quality is the concentration of skin cell fragments and human-borne contaminants (i.e bacteria, viruses) riding as passengers on skin tissue. Skin fragments often comprise over 50% of the volume of identifiable particles in indoor air. It is not possible in a microscopic analysis to differentiate human dander from animal or pet dander.

Although no direct health effects can be derived by their measurement, skin cell fragment concentrations are a good surrogate indicator of the total impact of fresh air transfer rates, occupant density, commensal bacteria potential, housekeeping and cleaning practices, and filtration of recirculated air in the building.

# BIOLOGICAL, CELLULOSIC, & SYNTHETIC FIBERS

## Typical Cellulosic / Synthetic Fiber Concentration Ranges

| DESCRIPTION | Classification | Surface Cts/mm² | Airborne Cts/m³ |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Outside--(Usually plant fragments) | Low | 0.1 - 5.0 | 100 - 1,000 |
| Inside (clean buildings) | Low | 0.1 - 5.0 | 100 - 1,000 |
| Inside (high activity) | Moderate | 5.0 - 10.0 | 1,000 - 5,000 |
| Inside (high activity/poor housekeeping) | High | >10.0 | 5,000 - 50,000 |

The cellulosic / synthetic fiber category covers a wide range of carbonaceous fibers that are commonly found in indoor samples. Fibers in this category include biogenic fibers (derived from biological activity, e.g. leaf and twig fragments, trichomes, spider web silk, cellulosic fibers), feather fibrils, and common synthetic fibers such as nylon or rayon. Indoor fiber emission sources can include architectural finishes, cellulose insulation, paper products, clothing, and carpeting. These fibers for the most part are anisotropic (crystalline), and will appear yellow and/or blue depending on their orientation when examined using a polarized light microscope with a full wave plate inserted. Some synthetic fibers will appear yellow in all orientation directions, that is, the same light vibration in all directions. Biogenic fibers generated from biological sources (plant, insect, or animal) by themselves are not normally a cause of allergy or illness symptoms. Elevated biogenic and fabric fibers may be an indication of inadequate housekeeping ventilation, high biogenic sources, and/or high occupancy rates.

### Common Fiber Types:

- Down feather fibril
- Dog hair
- Spider web
- "Kleenex" tissue (PLM)
- Cardboard (BF)
- Cardboard (PLM)
- Nylon carpet (BF)
- Nylon carpet (PLM)

# FIBERGLASS FIBERS

## Typical Fiberglass Concentration Ranges

| DESCRIPTION | Classification | Surface Cts/mm² | Airborne Cts/m³ |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Inside clean buildings | Low | <0.1 | <10 |
| Inside low | Typical-Low | 0.1 - 0.5 | 10 - 20 |
| Inside low-moderate | Low-moderate | 0.5 - 0.7 | 20 - 50 |
| Inside high activity | Moderate | 0.7 - 1.0 | 50 - 100 |
| Inside inadequate housekeeping | High | >1.0 | >100 |

Fiberglass fibers are composed of amorphous (non-crystalline) fibrous glass particles and are most commonly found in insulation products. Fibrous glass sources may include thermal or sound insulation, ceiling tiles, debris from renovation projects, or the degradation of HVAC system sound dampening insulation inside the ventilation ducting system.

Because "fiberglass" and mineral wool are manufactured by different processes, they are morphologically different but may be chemically similar. Fiberglass fibers are uniform along the entire width of the fiber, while mineral wool is characterized by non-uniform width and the presence of bulbous and rounded ends. Both fiber categories are isotropic (non-crystalline) and by definition the refractive index does not change with orientation. As a result, fiberglass fibers when viewed in cross-polarized light become invisible without the use of a retardation (full) wave plate in addition to polarized light. When a full wave retardation plate is inserted, these fibers will appear colorless in all orientations.

The macroscopic coloration of bulk insulation (e.g. yellow, pink, black) is due to the resin binder holding the insulation together and not the color of the glass fiber. The source and location of fiberglass insulation in a building can sometimes be differentiated by the resin droplet color used as a binding material on the glass fiber itself.

### Common Fiberglass Types:

- Black soundliner fiberglass
- Yellow "batt" insulation
- Pink "batt" insulation
- Yellow duct wrap insulation
- Mineral wool – ceiling tile
- Fiberglass (PLM-dispersion staining)

# OPAQUE PARTICLES OVERVIEW

*Initial analysis is performed by Optical Microscopy. Automated SEM analysis may be required to identify the exact composition of the dust and to identify the most likely source.*

## Typical Opaque Particle Concentration Ranges (excluding fire / combustion residue)

| DESCRIPTION | Classification | Surface Cts/mm² | Airborne Cts/m³ |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Inside clean buildings | Low | <10 | <1000 |
| Inside typical buildings | Typical-Low | 10 - 20 | 1,000 - 2,000 |
| Low-moderate dust | Low - Moderate | 20 - 50 | 2,000 - 5,000 |
| Moderate - building infiltration likely | Moderate | 50 - 100 | 5,000 - 10,000 |
| High - infiltration or building shedding | High | >100 | >10,000 |

The opaque particle category encompasses a wide range of unrelated particles that appear to be brown or black when observed using transmitted light microscopy. These optically opaque particles may visually be other colors to the naked eye or when examined using reflected light microscopy. These particles often require the use of reflected light microscopy (dark field), and/or SEM / X-ray analysis to identify the type, chemistry, or origin the particle. Commonly occurring optically opaque particles are generated from five major processes including:

1. Infiltration of optically opaque naturally occurring soil particles, biological particles, asphaltic debris, and tire rubber
