# MOLD & FUNGI – GENERAL AIRBORNE BACKGROUND LEVELS

When chronic moisture intrusion exists, or significant flooding occurs, elevated levels of primary colonizing molds can be present (e.g. Penicillium, Aspergillus, and Cladosporium). Secondary mold growth (e.g. Stachybotrys, Chaetomium, Ulocladium, and Trichoderma) can occur with the presence of chronic moisture. This can also facilitate the colonization of wood-destroying fungi (i.e. Serpula, Poria). Over time, these kinds of fungi can destroy structural wood components of a building and result in very high indoor airborne basidiospore concentrations.

## Overview on the interpretation of mold spore concentrations

A high variability in outdoor mold spore concentrations and their distribution exists on a hourly to daily basis. Levels are dependent on the quantity of local vegetation, the micro-climate, time of year, local weather patterns, and diurnal variation. As a result, caution must be used when simultaneously comparing limited data sets of inside and outside mold concentrations, or over generalizing any set of indoor/outdoor data to desert or snow covered environments. It is also generally accepted that "single-point" comparisons between indoor and outdoor concentrations should not be relied upon as the sole criteria for determining acceptable levels in buildings.

The table given below summarizes the regional geographic outdoor background ranges and the most common conditions associated with elevated indoor mold spore levels. The term "clean" refers to the classification definition of buildings given in our AIHA 2005 Publication entitled *A Regional Comparison of Mold Spore Concentrations Outdoors and Inside "Clean" and "Mold Contaminated" Southern California Buildings*, 2005, JOEH. This paper is also available on the "News and Information" Page of the EAA website. The term "clean" used by EAA refers to a building found to have no evidence of historical water intrusion and no visible evidence of elevated moisture conditions or mold growth determined by a systematic and thorough visual inspection.

# USING THE EAA LABORATORY REPORTS AND INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES

Environmental Analysis Associates has developed concise and understandable laboratory reports for the analysis and classification of airborne and surface mold, dust, and fire residue. The particles found are systematically classified in a way that allows investigators to differentiate the dust generated by occupant activity, building renovation and maintenance, HVAC system corrosion, furnishings, and/or infiltration of outdoor dust. Interpretation guidelines and color-coded comparison summary tables are provided (in addition to the laboratory reports) that can easily be added into your own site inspection reports. The color-coded summary comparison tables are based on historical data collected from thousands of buildings over the past 25+ years. The guidelines for using the summary comparison tables and analysis data provided by our own laboratory are given in the following pages.

## Classification Definitions

| Classification | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Low** | Concentration range found in the average "clean" non-impacted building |
| **Typical-low** | Concentration range found in the average building |
| **Low-moderate** | Concentration range found in buildings with infrequent cleaning or high occupancy |
| **Moderate** | Concentration range found in buildings with possible generating sources, infrequent cleaning, and/or inadequate filtration |
| **High** | Concentration range found in buildings with indoor generating sources and/or significant infiltration |

# MOLD & FUNGI – INDOOR GUIDELINES

## Typical Indoor Mold Spore Concentration Ranges (total)

| DESCRIPTION | Classification | Surface Cts/mm² | Airborne Cts/m³ |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Inside air "clean" HVAC supplied buildings | Low | <0.1 | <500 |
| Inside air "typical" residential | Typical-Low | 0.1 - 1.0 | 500 -1,000 |
| Moderate dust / high settled spores | Low - Moderate | 1.0 - 10.0 | 1,000 - 5,000 |
| Mold growth possible | Moderate - High * | 10 - 50 | * 5000 - 20,000 |
| Mold growth significant | High | * >50 | * >20,000 |

*\* Depends upon the genera / species present*

As a general observation, the total indoor airborne spore concentrations in a typical "clean" HVAC supplied building are less than the average regional outside concentrations, or are less than approximately 1,000 cts/m³. Aspergillus /Penicillium and other hyaline (clear) spores are on average less than 700 cts/m³. Stachybotrys, Chaetomium, and Ulocladium (potential indicators of chronic surface moisture) are often recovered in low concentrations in indoor samples as a result of normal infiltration. Therefore, detection in low concentrations does not automatically indicate an indoor growth source. Remember, there is always a likely exception to every rule or generalization, and because there is no direct relationship between simultaneously collected indoor and outdoor samples, performing a direct comparison with a limited number of samples can be misleading. An expected range of variability of 5 to 10 fold differences should be used when comparing side-by-side sets of limited data.
