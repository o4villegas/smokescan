The EAA Particle Classification System uses particle morphology, optical properties, and assemblage association to classify common particles. In some cases the classification may not accurately represent the exact identity of an individual particle. Unusual particles can be placed in the "Other" category when found in elevated concentrations. The particles be loosely classified and generated by biological activity (biogenic), or inorganic processes. Fibrous particles can be generated by biological, inorganic, or man-made processes. A recommended flow analysis guideline is given on the following page.

## BIOGENIC

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Mold Spores | and filamentous structures generated from fungal growth |
| Algae and protozoan organisms | Chlorophyll producing "algae" spores or filaments and other protozoans associated with biofilm generation |
| Pollen & fern spores | Reproductive spores generated by flowering plants and ferns |
| Skin cell fragments (Dander) | Skin cell fragments generated by human or animals |
| Insect parts | All particles associated with insects including leg parts, wing scales, and body chiton fragments |

## FIBROUS

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Fibrous glass fibers (Isotropic) | Fibrous transparent glass fibers (fiberglass & mineral wool is used primarily as insulation materials and fillers in ceiling tiles) |
| Cellulosic fibers (Anisotropic) | Natural cellulosic fibrous materials used as clothing, paper, etc. |
| Synthetic fibers | Fibrous manufactured fibers used as clothing, bedding, drapes, carpeting, etc. (primarily nylon, rayon, etc.) |

## INORGANIC / ANTHROPOGENIC

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Opaque particles | Particles that are optically opaque and appear as dark brown or black when using transmitted light microscopy. Particles are typically decayed biological material, corrosion particles, and paints / pigments. |
| Fire/combustion residue | Combustion particles including Soot, Char, Ash, and other burned plant or soil material including mineral grains, plant phytoliths, or pollen. Indoor fire residue will also include other plastics, furniture finishes, and construction materials |
| Anthropogenic/mineral particles | Crystalline soil mineral grains and/or construction materials |
| Other uncommon particles | Less common particles that may not directly fit the categories described above. These could include copier toner, starch grains, droplet-like particles, specific unique minerals, or corrosion particles. |

# DUST ANALYSIS FLOW DIAGRAM GUIDE

The EAA dust analysis method provides a systematic way of solving indoor dust complaints using an initial screening of airborne and surface dust samples using Optical Microscopy. When the exact source requires identification, automated SEM / X-ray particle analysis procedures can be performed.

## Optical Microscopy – Mold and dust analysis (airborne and surface samples)

### Mold / Pollen / Algae

- **Not elevated** → No further action
- **Elevated** → Further investigation warranted

### Cellulosic/Synthetic fibers

- **Not elevated** → No further action
- **Elevated** → Further investigation warranted

### Opaque dust

- **Not elevated** → No further action
- **Elevated** → Further investigation warranted → Source ID / chemistry / size distribution

### Crystalline Mineral Dust

- **Not elevated** → No further action
- **Elevated** → Further investigation warranted → Source ID / chemistry / size distribution

### Fire / Combustion residue

- **Not elevated** → No further action
- **Elevated / interferences** → Further investigation warranted → Source ID / chemistry / size distribution

## Automated Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)

- Particle chemistry
- Size distribution
- Particle ID → **Source identification**

# MOLD & FUNGI - ECOLOGY

Elevated mold spore concentrations in both the indoor and outdoor environment are known to cause allergy symptoms and are occasionally responsible for respiratory illness in immuno-compromised individuals. Elevated mold spore concentrations in the indoor environment can be caused by outdoor infiltration or from indoor growth sources when elevated surface moisture and humidity are present.

## Conditions under which indoor mold growth can occur

- Historical flooding without proper cleanup
- Moisture intrusion occurring through sub-flooring, walls, windows, or roofs
- Plumbing, water line leak, toilet overflows or sewer backups
- Moisture condensation around windows
- Moisture condensation inside HVAC systems
- Persistent elevated relative humidity above 70%, and inadequate housekeeping

## Ecology of molds and fungi

Mold and fungi require three basic criteria to colonize the inside of a building:

- A source of moisture
- A food source
- Lack of surface disturbance and/or air movement

Moisture sources in buildings occur most commonly as water and/or sewer leaks, moisture intrusion through walls and foundations, or as condensation around windows or inside HVAC systems. For example, in some parts of the country such as the southeast United States, the relative humidity during certain times of the year is high enough to act as a significant moisture source on its own.

Indoor food sources for mold can be any organic material provided by a flood, sewer backup, or cellulosic materials present in the building such as carpet backing, linoleum backing, drywall paper, or ceiling panels. The buildup of plant and/or skin cell fragments or debris on inorganic surfaces is also a common source. Skin cell fragments are a significant food and mold colonizing source in office buildings and homes where a high occupancy exists, or adequate housekeeping is not maintained.

Molds colonize most readily where air disturbance is minimal and both the surface and airborne humidity can remain high. For this reason, mold colonization occurs most frequently in closed or concealed spaces such as closets, storerooms, basements, refrigeration units, or on the backside or underside surfaces of furniture.

# MOLD & FUNGI – HEALTH EFFECTS

## Potential health effects from inhalation of mold and fungal spores:

Based on the existing literature, it is generally accepted in the medical community that exposure to mold may result in symptoms consistent with a cold, flu, allergy hay fever, or asthma in some people. Other individuals may have no symptoms at all. It is generally accepted that there are no long term or permanent health effects from exposure to mold once the occupant is removed from the property, or the "elevated" condition has been corrected. The medical community also generally recognizes that those who are known to be allergic to molds and those with asthma may have a higher risk of allergic reactions and should take extra precautions when in such situations. Laboratory analysis of airborne or surface samples by themselves cannot determine the associated health risks in any specific environment.

## Common outdoor molds

Outdoor assemblages of mold spores are most commonly associated with the following genera (listed in approximate order of descending abundance):

- Cladosporium
- Mushroom-like fungi (Ascospores and Basidiospores)
- Alternaria
- Rusts and Smuts (colonizing primary flower and leaf parts)
- Aspergillus & Penicillium (soil and moist cellulosic surfaces).

All of the above mentioned mold genera colonize decaying vegetation and/or soil.

## Common molds associated with indoor mold "growth"

The most common molds associated with indoor amplification (over 90% of the typical mold growth found inside buildings) given in approximate order of descending abundance are listed below:

- Penicillium
- Aspergillus (flavus, fumigatus, terrus, versicolor, niger)
- Cladosporium
- Chaetomium
- Stachybotrys
- Zygomycetes (Mucor & Rhizopus)
- Chaetomium
- Ulocladium
- Trichoderma
