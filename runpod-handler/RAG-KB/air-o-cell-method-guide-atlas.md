# INTERPRETATION GUIDE BACKGROUND

## Airborne and Surface Dust Analysis Using Optical Microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy

Environmental Analysis Associates, Inc. (EAA) is one of only a few environmental testing laboratories in the country specializing in comprehensive dust and aerosol testing using the full range of Optical and Electron Microscopy methods. Our historical field experience also allows us to provide comprehensive interpretation support of the resulting data generated by our laboratory. Mr. Daniel Baxter is the owner of EAA, and inventor of the Air-O-Cell®, the most widely used airborne mold and dust sampler in the country.

This new version of the method guide is designed to provide our clients with practical guidance for the identification, measurement, and interpretation of indoor dust samples using Optical and Electron Microscopy. The suggested Optical Microscopy guideline ranges and color-coded summary tables provided in this guide are based on historical data collected by EAA over the past 25 years. The data should be used for comparative purposes only, and are not industry standards that can be directly used for hazard assessment. These guidelines are based on airborne sampling using the Air-O-Cell® slit impaction sampler, and surface adhesive tape lift sampling using the Zefon Bio-tape® media or cellophane tape. EAA has systematically classified and quantified the most commonly occurring particle categories found both outdoors and indoors. The guide also integrates new Automated SEM/X-ray analysis procedures developed by EAA allowing the precise chemical and size analysis of particle assemblages, and the identification of indoor contamination source(s).

Use of the data contained within our reports requires proper guidance, as industry standards for data interpretation do not currently exist. The data should be used as a "screening" tool to separate the difference between typical and atypical indoor dust conditions, and not as criteria for declaring an environment contaminated, safe, or unsafe, or intending to satisfying a government standard. This document (combined with analysis reports provided by EAA) should be used as a secondary information to supplement an onsite visual inspection and industry accepted tests where they are applicable.

Although it is often not possible for the microscopist to precisely identify the particle, or specific emission source by analyzing the air or surface sample alone, identifying "atypical" particle concentrations is the first step used to identify and locate a potential contamination source. Identification and classification procedures use the full range of optical microscopy methods including transmitted light bright field (BF), polarized light microscopy (PLM), and reflected light/dark field microscopy (RLDF). Samples can be further analyzed for their elemental chemistry and size distribution (when warranted) by automated Scanning Electron Microscopy. A flow diagram for comprehensive analysis is given on page 5 of this guide.

Over the past 5 years Environmental Analysis has refined Automated Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis procedures to practically analyze the elemental "assemblage" chemistry and size distribution analysis of airborne and surface dust samples. The automated SEM/X-ray analysis methods developed by EAA make it routinely possible to obtain rapid and comprehensive chemical and statistical size analysis of airborne and surface dust samples. This information is compiled into unique and concise reports that fully characterize the sample and provide guidance on the most probable dust emission source.

*Note: The use of the terms "Low", "Moderate", and "High" to describe airborne or surface concentrations are for comparative purposes, and the categories of "moderate" or "high" do not imply a hazard or "unsafe" conditions.*

# THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INDOOR AND OUTDOOR AIR

There are significant differences between indoor and outdoor dust particle "assemblages". A dust particle "assemblage" is a grouping of different types of particles that are found in association with each other within defined types of environments, or when found together may represent certain types of environmental conditions. Assemblage analysis is commonly used in archeology, and the dating of fossils or pollen. Until recently, it has not routinely been used as a standard method to identify potential indoor air quality problems. For the most part, existing "indoor air quality regulations" address ventilation, and exposure to industry regulated toxic, irritant, or volatile chemicals or particles. These standard methods work well when there is a defined odor and/or known exposure hazard that has been identified. This approach is less successful when used to solve nebulous complaints associated with perceived irritation or comfort. In other words, if the particles are not classified as hazardous or as an irritant, even if they are the most commonly occurring particulate found in buildings, they are not routinely assessed or monitored by traditional EPA, OSHA, or ASTM methods. A combined systematic evaluation of the concentration or distribution of particles that are representative of the operational building are usually helpful when standard or regulated material testing methods fail to resolve a complaint. EAA fills this testing gap by analyzing the differences in particle distributions that are generated by the operational conditions and particle generation within the building. The deviations from well filtered outside air are often responsible for irritation or comfort complaints, or indicative of adverse building "shedding" conditions that can be identified and resolved. Several illustrative examples of particle distributions and their relationship to a building environment are given on the following two pages.

## Outdoor air – rural / natural background

- Vegetation particles
- Pollen
- Mold spores
- Soil minerals
- Insect droppings

## Outdoor air – city / urban / industrial influence

- Outdoor air particles described above
- Road dust – asphalt & tire rubber
- Automotive combustion particles
- Soil minerals

## Indoor office & residential environments

# THE EAA PARTICLE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM

The EAA Particle Classification System uses particle morphology, optical properties, and assemblage association to classify common particles. In some cases the classification may not accurately represent the exact identity of an individual particle. Unusual particles can be placed in the "Other" category when found in elevated concentrations. The particles be loosely classified and generated by biological activity (biogenic), or inorganic processes. Fibrous particles can be generated by biological, inorganic, or man-made processes. A recommended flow analysis guideline is given on the following page.

## BIOGENIC

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Mold Spores | and filamentous structures generated from fungal growth |
| Algae and protozoan organisms | Chlorophyll producing "algae" spores or filaments and other protozoans associated with biofilm generation |
| Pollen & fern spores | Reproductive spores generated by flowering plants and ferns |
| Skin cell fragments (Dander) | Skin cell fragments generated by human or animals |
| Insect parts | All particles associated with insects including leg parts, wing scales, and body chiton fragments |

## FIBROUS

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Fibrous glass fibers (Isotropic) | Fibrous transparent glass fibers (fiberglass & mineral wool is used primarily as insulation materials and fillers in ceiling tiles) |
| Cellulosic fibers (Anisotropic) | Natural cellulosic fibrous materials used as clothing, paper, etc. |
| Synthetic fibers | Fibrous manufactured fibers used as clothing, bedding, drapes, carpeting, etc. (primarily nylon, rayon, etc.) |

## INORGANIC / ANTHROPOGENIC

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Opaque particles | Particles that are optically opaque and appear as dark brown or black when using transmitted light microscopy. Particles are typically decayed biological material, corrosion particles, and paints / pigments. |
| Fire/combustion residue | Combustion particles including Soot, Char, Ash, and other burned plant or soil material including mineral grains, plant phytoliths, or pollen. Indoor fire residue will also include other plastics, furniture finishes, and construction materials |
| Anthropogenic/mineral particles | Crystalline soil mineral grains and/or construction materials |
| Other uncommon particles | Less common particles that may not directly fit the categories described above. These could include copier toner, starch grains, droplet-like particles, specific unique minerals, or corrosion particles. |

# MOLD & FUNGI - ECOLOGY

Elevated mold spore concentrations in both the indoor and outdoor environment are known to cause allergy symptoms and are occasionally responsible for respiratory illness in immuno-compromised individuals. Elevated mold spore concentrations in the indoor environment can be caused by outdoor infiltration or from indoor growth sources when elevated surface moisture and humidity are present.

## Conditions under which indoor mold growth can occur

- Historical flooding without proper cleanup
- Moisture intrusion occurring through sub-flooring, walls, windows, or roofs
- Plumbing, water line leak, toilet overflows or sewer backups
- Moisture condensation around windows
- Moisture condensation inside HVAC systems
- Persistent elevated relative humidity above 70%, and inadequate housekeeping

## Ecology of molds and fungi

Mold and fungi require three basic criteria to colonize the inside of a building:

- A source of moisture
- A food source
- Lack of surface disturbance and/or air movement

Moisture sources in buildings occur most commonly as water and/or sewer leaks, moisture intrusion through walls and foundations, or as condensation around windows or inside HVAC systems. For example, in some parts of the country such as the southeast United States, the relative humidity during certain times of the year is high enough to act as a significant moisture source on its own.

Indoor food sources for mold can be any organic material provided by a flood, sewer backup, or cellulosic materials present in the building such as carpet backing, linoleum backing, drywall paper, or ceiling panels. The buildup of plant and/or skin cell fragments or debris on inorganic surfaces is also a common source. Skin cell fragments are a significant food and mold colonizing source in office buildings and homes where a high occupancy exists, or adequate housekeeping is not maintained.

Molds colonize most readily where air disturbance is minimal and both the surface and airborne humidity can remain high. For this reason, mold colonization occurs most frequently in closed or concealed spaces such as closets, storerooms, basements, refrigeration units, or on the backside or underside surfaces of furniture.

# MOLD & FUNGI – HEALTH EFFECTS

## Potential health effects from inhalation of mold and fungal spores:

Based on the existing literature, it is generally accepted in the medical community that exposure to mold may result in symptoms consistent with a cold, flu, allergy hay fever, or asthma in some people. Other individuals may have no symptoms at all. It is generally accepted that there are no long term or permanent health effects from exposure to mold once the occupant is removed from the property, or the "elevated" condition has been corrected. The medical community also generally recognizes that those who are known to be allergic to molds and those with asthma may have a higher risk of allergic reactions and should take extra precautions when in such situations. Laboratory analysis of airborne or surface samples by themselves cannot determine the associated health risks in any specific environment.

## Common outdoor molds

Outdoor assemblages of mold spores are most commonly associated with the following genera (listed in approximate order of descending abundance):

- Cladosporium
- Mushroom-like fungi (Ascospores and Basidiospores)
- Alternaria
- Rusts and Smuts (colonizing primary flower and leaf parts)
- Aspergillus & Penicillium (soil and moist cellulosic surfaces).

All of the above mentioned mold genera colonize decaying vegetation and/or soil.

## Common molds associated with indoor mold "growth"

The most common molds associated with indoor amplification (over 90% of the typical mold growth found inside buildings) given in approximate order of descending abundance are listed below:

- Penicillium
- Aspergillus (flavus, fumigatus, terrus, versicolor, niger)
- Cladosporium
- Chaetomium
- Stachybotrys
- Zygomycetes (Mucor & Rhizopus)
- Chaetomium
- Ulocladium
- Trichoderma

# MOLD & FUNGI – GENERAL AIRBORNE BACKGROUND LEVELS

When chronic moisture intrusion exists, or significant flooding occurs, elevated levels of primary colonizing molds can be present (e.g. Penicillium, Aspergillus, and Cladosporium). Secondary mold growth (e.g. Stachybotrys, Chaetomium, Ulocladium, and Trichoderma) can occur with the presence of chronic moisture. This can also facilitate the colonization of wood-destroying fungi (i.e. Serpula, Poria). Over time, these kinds of fungi can destroy structural wood components of a building and result in very high indoor airborne basidiospore concentrations.

## Overview on the interpretation of mold spore concentrations

A high variability in outdoor mold spore concentrations and their distribution exists on a hourly to daily basis. Levels are dependent on the quantity of local vegetation, the micro-climate, time of year, local weather patterns, and diurnal variation. As a result, caution must be used when simultaneously comparing limited data sets of inside and outside mold concentrations, or over generalizing any set of indoor/outdoor data to desert or snow covered environments. It is also generally accepted that "single-point" comparisons between indoor and outdoor concentrations should not be relied upon as the sole criteria for determining acceptable levels in buildings.

The table given below summarizes the regional geographic outdoor background ranges and the most common conditions associated with elevated indoor mold spore levels. The term "clean" refers to the classification definition of buildings given in our AIHA 2005 Publication entitled *A Regional Comparison of Mold Spore Concentrations Outdoors and Inside "Clean" and "Mold Contaminated" Southern California Buildings*, 2005, JOEH. This paper is also available on the "News and Information" Page of the EAA website. The term "clean" used by EAA refers to a building found to have no evidence of historical water intrusion and no visible evidence of elevated moisture conditions or mold growth determined by a systematic and thorough visual inspection.

# USING THE EAA LABORATORY REPORTS AND INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES

Environmental Analysis Associates has developed concise and understandable laboratory reports for the analysis and classification of airborne and surface mold, dust, and fire residue. The particles found are systematically classified in a way that allows investigators to differentiate the dust generated by occupant activity, building renovation and maintenance, HVAC system corrosion, furnishings, and/or infiltration of outdoor dust. Interpretation guidelines and color-coded comparison summary tables are provided (in addition to the laboratory reports) that can easily be added into your own site inspection reports. The color-coded summary comparison tables are based on historical data collected from thousands of buildings over the past 25+ years. The guidelines for using the summary comparison tables and analysis data provided by our own laboratory are given in the following pages.

## Classification Definitions

| Classification | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Low** | Concentration range found in the average "clean" non-impacted building |
| **Typical-low** | Concentration range found in the average building |
| **Low-moderate** | Concentration range found in buildings with infrequent cleaning or high occupancy |
| **Moderate** | Concentration range found in buildings with possible generating sources, infrequent cleaning, and/or inadequate filtration |
| **High** | Concentration range found in buildings with indoor generating sources and/or significant infiltration |

# MOLD & FUNGI – INDOOR GUIDELINES

## Typical Indoor Mold Spore Concentration Ranges (total)

| DESCRIPTION | Classification | Surface Cts/mm² | Airborne Cts/m³ |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Inside air "clean" HVAC supplied buildings | Low | <0.1 | <500 |
| Inside air "typical" residential | Typical-Low | 0.1 - 1.0 | 500 -1,000 |
| Moderate dust / high settled spores | Low - Moderate | 1.0 - 10.0 | 1,000 - 5,000 |
| Mold growth possible | Moderate - High * | 10 - 50 | * 5000 - 20,000 |
| Mold growth significant | High | * >50 | * >20,000 |

*\* Depends upon the genera / species present*

As a general observation, the total indoor airborne spore concentrations in a typical "clean" HVAC supplied building are less than the average regional outside concentrations, or are less than approximately 1,000 cts/m³. Aspergillus /Penicillium and other hyaline (clear) spores are on average less than 700 cts/m³. Stachybotrys, Chaetomium, and Ulocladium (potential indicators of chronic surface moisture) are often recovered in low concentrations in indoor samples as a result of normal infiltration. Therefore, detection in low concentrations does not automatically indicate an indoor growth source. Remember, there is always a likely exception to every rule or generalization, and because there is no direct relationship between simultaneously collected indoor and outdoor samples, performing a direct comparison with a limited number of samples can be misleading. An expected range of variability of 5 to 10 fold differences should be used when comparing side-by-side sets of limited data.

## Mold spores commonly found outdoors and indoors

- Cladosporium
- Ascospores
- "Poria" dry rot spores
- Alternaria
- Bipolaris-like
- Epiccocum
- Curvularia
- Smut-like

## Mold spores most commonly associated with indoor growth (amplification)

- Penicillium/Aspergillus
- Stachybotrys
- Chaetomium
- Pithomyces (and Ulocladium)
- Trichoderma

# POLLEN / FERN SPORES

## Typical Indoor Pollen And Fern Spore Concentration Ranges

| DESCRIPTION | Classification | Surface (cts/mm²) | Airborne (cts/m³) |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Inside "clean" | Very low | ND - 0.1 | ND |
| Inside (low / typical) | Low | 0.1 - 0.3 | <30 |
| Inside (moderate) - Infiltration | Moderate | 0.3 - 1.0 | 30 - 100 |
| Inside (high) – Significant infiltration | High | >1.0 | > 100 |

*Note: All concentrations refer to measurements obtained during the growing seasons reflecting local California data. Other geographic regions could be higher or lower than the approximate ranges given above.*

The presence of pollen or fern spores in the indoor environment is almost always the result of air infiltration from the outdoor environment. In a typical HVAC air supplied building, airborne pollen concentrations will be very low (less than 10ct/m³) or not detected at all. Sensitive individuals can mistakenly attribute complaints to the interior of a building that are actually the result of exterior infiltration or other allergen sources. Landscaping in building courtyards can also be a factor with perceived indoor problems. The time of year, the home environment, and pathway to work, may also be significant sources for potential exposure.

According to the literature, the individual allergy response to pollen exposure is highly variable. Some individuals with pollen allergies may begin to exhibit symptoms when airborne concentrations exceed approximately 50 cts/m³, especially with grass or highly allergenic pollen such as ragweed. Outdoor airborne levels can range from not detected to over 1,000 cts/m³ depending on the geographic location, local vegetation, and season. The time of day when symptoms are pronounced is extremely critical for proper source diagnosis. Because of the wide range and severity of individual pollen allergenicity, consultation with an Allergist may be warranted in the rare occasions where elevated indoor pollen concentrations have been measured.

Pollen identification in the EAA analysis report is given as the genus when known, or as the taxonomic classification (e.g. inaperturate, triporate, tricolpate, etc.) when the pollen cannot be readily identified. Detailed analysis of pollen species within our reports is only provided upon special request.

### Common Pollen Types:

- Acacia
- Grass
- Fir
- Betula (Birch)
- Tricolporate (classification)
- Pinus
- Ragweed
- Fern spores

# ALGAE & BIO-FILM ORGANISMS

## Typical Algae and Other Bio-film Organism Concentration Ranges

| DESCRIPTION | Classification | Cts/mm² | Cts/m³ |
|-------------|----------------|---------|--------|
| Outside | Wide range | Not applicable | 10 - 1,000 |
| Inside | Low | ND - 0.1 | ND - 50 |
| Inside | Moderate | 0.1 - 0.5 | 50 - 200 |
| Inside | High | >0.5 | > 200 |

When algae, bio-film deposits, protozoan organisms, etc. are detected in any concentration in indoor samples, a stagnant water source is likely present somewhere in proximity to the air intake stream, or there are other potential nearby water reservoirs. Although significant information is not readily available regarding health effects, algae and bio-film organisms are potential indicators of persistent moisture and other potential bacteriological or protozoa reservoirs.

# SKIN CELL FRAGMENTS – (DANDER)

## Typical Skin Cell Fragment Concentration Ranges

| DESCRIPTION | Classification | Surface Cts/mm² | Airborne Cts/m³ |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Outside | Low | <0.1 | 50 - 1,000 |
| Inside air clean buildings | Low | 0.1 - 10.0 | 1,000 - 10,000 |
| Inside air high activity | Moderate | 10.0 - 100 | 10,000 - 20,000 |
| High activity / poor housekeeping | High | >100 | 20,000 - 100,000 |

Dander or skin cell fragments are the most common source of particle debris in indoor samples. The skin cell fragment category includes particle concentrations greater than ~20um in diameter. One of the biggest differences between inside and outside air quality is the concentration of skin cell fragments and human-borne contaminants (i.e bacteria, viruses) riding as passengers on skin tissue. Skin fragments often comprise over 50% of the volume of identifiable particles in indoor air. It is not possible in a microscopic analysis to differentiate human dander from animal or pet dander.

Although no direct health effects can be derived by their measurement, skin cell fragment concentrations are a good surrogate indicator of the total impact of fresh air transfer rates, occupant density, commensal bacteria potential, housekeeping and cleaning practices, and filtration of recirculated air in the building.

# BIOLOGICAL, CELLULOSIC, & SYNTHETIC FIBERS

## Typical Cellulosic / Synthetic Fiber Concentration Ranges

| DESCRIPTION | Classification | Surface Cts/mm² | Airborne Cts/m³ |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Outside--(Usually plant fragments) | Low | 0.1 - 5.0 | 100 - 1,000 |
| Inside (clean buildings) | Low | 0.1 - 5.0 | 100 - 1,000 |
| Inside (high activity) | Moderate | 5.0 - 10.0 | 1,000 - 5,000 |
| Inside (high activity/poor housekeeping) | High | >10.0 | 5,000 - 50,000 |

The cellulosic / synthetic fiber category covers a wide range of carbonaceous fibers that are commonly found in indoor samples. Fibers in this category include biogenic fibers (derived from biological activity, e.g. leaf and twig fragments, trichomes, spider web silk, cellulosic fibers), feather fibrils, and common synthetic fibers such as nylon or rayon. Indoor fiber emission sources can include architectural finishes, cellulose insulation, paper products, clothing, and carpeting. These fibers for the most part are anisotropic (crystalline), and will appear yellow and/or blue depending on their orientation when examined using a polarized light microscope with a full wave plate inserted. Some synthetic fibers will appear yellow in all orientation directions, that is, the same light vibration in all directions. Biogenic fibers generated from biological sources (plant, insect, or animal) by themselves are not normally a cause of allergy or illness symptoms. Elevated biogenic and fabric fibers may be an indication of inadequate housekeeping ventilation, high biogenic sources, and/or high occupancy rates.

### Common Fiber Types:

- Down feather fibril

# FIBERGLASS FIBERS

## Typical Fiberglass Concentration Ranges

| DESCRIPTION | Classification | Surface Cts/mm² | Airborne Cts/m³ |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Inside clean buildings | Low | <0.1 | <10 |
| Inside low | Typical-Low | 0.1 - 0.5 | 10 - 20 |
| Inside low-moderate | Low-moderate | 0.5 - 0.7 | 20 - 50 |
| Inside high activity | Moderate | 0.7 - 1.0 | 50 - 100 |
| Inside inadequate housekeeping | High | >1.0 | >100 |

Fiberglass fibers are composed of amorphous (non-crystalline) fibrous glass particles and are most commonly found in insulation products. Fibrous glass sources may include thermal or sound insulation, ceiling tiles, debris from renovation projects, or the degradation of HVAC system sound dampening insulation inside the ventilation ducting system.

Because "fiberglass" and mineral wool are manufactured by different processes, they are morphologically different but may be chemically similar. Fiberglass fibers are uniform along the entire width of the fiber, while mineral wool is characterized by non-uniform width and the presence of bulbous and rounded ends. Both fiber categories are isotropic (non-crystalline) and by definition the refractive index does not change with orientation. As a result, fiberglass fibers when viewed in cross-polarized light become invisible without the use of a retardation (full) wave plate in addition to polarized light. When a full wave retardation plate is inserted, these fibers will appear colorless in all orientations.

The macroscopic coloration of bulk insulation (e.g. yellow, pink, black) is due to the resin binder holding the insulation together and not the color of the glass fiber. The source and location of fiberglass insulation in a building can sometimes be differentiated by the resin droplet color used as a binding material on the glass fiber itself.

### Common Fiberglass Types:

- Black soundliner fiberglass
- Yellow "batt" insulation
- Pink "batt" insulation
- Yellow duct wrap insulation
- Mineral wool – ceiling tile
- Fiberglass (PLM-dispersion staining)

# OPAQUE PARTICLES OVERVIEW

*Initial analysis is performed by Optical Microscopy. Automated SEM analysis may be required to identify the exact composition of the dust and to identify the most likely source.*

## Typical Opaque Particle Concentration Ranges (excluding fire / combustion residue)

| DESCRIPTION | Classification | Surface Cts/mm² | Airborne Cts/m³ |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Inside clean buildings | Low | <10 | <1000 |
| Inside typical buildings | Typical-Low | 10 - 20 | 1,000 - 2,000 |
| Low-moderate dust | Low - Moderate | 20 - 50 | 2,000 - 5,000 |
| Moderate - building infiltration likely | Moderate | 50 - 100 | 5,000 - 10,000 |
| High - infiltration or building shedding | High | >100 | >10,000 |

The opaque particle category encompasses a wide range of unrelated particles that appear to be brown or black when observed using transmitted light microscopy. These optically opaque particles may visually be other colors to the naked eye or when examined using reflected light microscopy. These particles often require the use of reflected light microscopy (dark field), and/or SEM / X-ray analysis to identify the type, chemistry, or origin the particle. Commonly occurring optically opaque particles are generated from five major processes including:

1. Infiltration of optically opaque naturally occurring soil particles, biological particles, asphaltic debris, and tire rubber
2. Biological / biogenic decay – Decayed skin cells, bio-films, insect droppings, oil residues
3. Corrosion – Degradation of metal HVAC components, pipes, paint, pigments
4. Friction/abrasion – Materials released as result of HVAC component vibration and moving parts
5. Combustion – Burning and heating of biogenic, organic, and other combustible materials

Micrographs of these various types of opaque particles are given on the following pages.

The most common outdoor sources of particles are soil, decayed vegetation, automobile emissions, insect droppings, and fire residue particles.

The most common indoor generated particles include combustion emissions (soot & char), paint, binders from degrading sound liners in HVAC systems, biogenic debris (biological origin, e.g. insect droppings, decayed biological debris, etc.), fan belt rubber particles, oil residue/dust agglomerates, copier toner, and corrosion from HVAC components and metal ducting. Determining the particle chemistry and the generating source usually requires additional analysis by automated Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) / X-ray analysis. The airborne concentration of total "opaque" particles does not normally occur in concentrations exceeding approximately 5,000 cts/m³ in "clean" indoor environments. Identification of the particle origin is not always possible, however, should be investigated as a possible contributor to air quality complaints when airborne concentrations exceed ~10,000 cts/m³.

From a morphological standpoint, biologically derived opaque particles can often be separated from other types of opaque particles. In some cases opaque particles cannot be morphologically differentiated from corrosion shedding particles without using additional analysis by Scanning Electron Microscopy / X-ray or chemical analysis.

# OPAQUE PARTICLES (Primarily biogenic)

## Typical Opaque Particle Concentration Ranges (excluding fire / combustion residue)

| DESCRIPTION | Classification | Surface Cts/mm² | Airborne Cts/m³ |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Inside clean buildings | Low | <10 | <1000 |
| Inside typical buildings | Typical-low | 10 - 20 | 1,000 - 2,000 |
| Low-moderate dust | Low-Moderate | 20 - 50 | 2,000 - 5,000 |
| Moderate | Moderate | 50 - 100 | 5,000 - 10,000 |
| High | High | >100 | >10,000 |

Biogenic opaque black or brown debris are derived from the chemical or biological decomposition of organically derived debris. The most common indoor sources are dander, plant fragments, insect droppings, etc. From a morphological standpoint, biologically derived opaque particles can often be separated from other types of opaque particles. Most biogenic debris have irregular, rounded, and "fuzzy" edge definition and lack the presence of straight particle edges, cleavage planes, or fracture marks. They also have a variability in optical density and will show an irregular variation in color and/or light transmission near the edge and/or throughout the particle. Examples of high levels of airborne biogenic derived debris (i.e. >100,000 cts/m³) are given below:

- Outdoor plant/soil debris & insect droppings
- HVAC duct residue
- Decaying fungal debris
- Floor sweepings from a garage

# OPAQUE PARTICLES (Corrosion & friction)

## Typical Opaque Particle Concentration Ranges

| DESCRIPTION | Classification | Surface Cts/mm² | Airborne Cts/m³ |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Inside clean buildings | Low | <10 | <1000 |
| Inside typical buildings | Typical-low | 10 - 20 | 1,000 - 2,000 |
| Low-moderate dust | Low-Moderate | 20 - 50 | 2,000 - 5,000 |
| Moderate - building shedding possible | Moderate | 50 - 100 | 5,000 - 10,000 |
| High – building shedding likely | High | >100 | >10,000 |

Man-made and opaque corrosion particles are derived from chemical or physical degradation, corrosion, and shedding of mineral or resinous debris. The most common indoor sources are metal corrosion from HVAC system components, or pigment and paint shedding from building surfaces. These types of opaque particles can often be separated from other sources by using a combination of transmitted and reflected light microscopy. Exact identification and quantification may require automated SEM / X-ray analysis.

Most non-biogenic opaque particles have angular and distinct edges, and a low variation in optical density from the edge to the center of the particle in transmitted light illumination. They can often be identified or classified using reflected light (dark field) microscopy (see bottom picture of HVAC corrosion).

### Common Corrosion Particle Types:

- Iron rust particles
- Copier toner
- Tire rubber particles
- HVAC system corrosion particles (Aluminum, Iron, and Zinc oxide particles)

# OPAQUE PARTICLES – WILDFIRE COMBUSTION RESIDUE

## Typical Wildfire / Combustion Particle Concentration Ranges

| DESCRIPTION | Classification | Surface Ratio % | Surface Cts/mm² | Airborne cts/m³ |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Very low / clean | Typical-low | <1% | <1 | <500 |
| Low-Typical | Upper Background | <3% | 1-5 | 500 - 1,000 |
| Moderately elevated | Moderate | 3 - 10% | 10 - 50 | 1,000 - 10,000 |
| High / source present | Elevated | >10% | >50 | >10,000 |

Wildfire combustion particles are a complex mixture of cellulose vegetation, burned soil, residual salts, and crystalline calcium and silica vegetation particles (phytoliths). Quantifying airborne and surface fire combustion contamination is a multi-step process requiring Optical Microscopy (Polarized Light & Reflected Light). Scanning Electron Microscopy / X-ray analysis can be utilized to differentiate look-alike interference particles from actual combustion residue. Wildfire combustion particles can be separated into three basic combustion categories (soot, char, and ash). There are also other indicator particles (e.g. burned soil particles, pollen, plant phytoliths) that can assist in the differentiation of wildfire residues from other types of combustion sources.

### Combustion Categories:

**Soot** – Residues from the combustion of organic resins and compounds

**Char** – Incomplete combustion of cellulose vegetation material

**Ash** – The residual mineral elements remaining after combustion (primarily Calcium, Sodium, Magnesium, and Potassium salts)

### Wildfire Indicators:

- Burned/carbonized mineral grains
- Burned pollen
- Burned plant phytoliths

# INSECT PARTS

## Typical Insect Part Concentration Ranges

| DESCRIPTION | Classification | Surface Cts/mm² | Airborne Cts/m³ |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Inside low background | Typical-low | <0.1 | <50 |
| Inside moderate | Moderate | 0.1 - 10.0 | 50 - 500 |
| Inside high and potential infestation | High | >10.0 | >500 |

Most other recognizable biogenic particles are comprised of whole insects or insect fragments (e.g. body parts, antennae, legs, scales, body hairs, and wing fragments). Bird feather fibrils are occasionally detected as well. In clean indoor environments, insect parts are occasionally detected, however, airborne concentrations above ~100 cts/m³ in air samples are not routinely measured. Elevated concentrations of wings scales, body parts, or insect droppings found in airborne or surface samples may be an indicator of an infestation or inadequate building maintenance and/or air filtration. Occasionally dust mites are also found when inadequate housekeeping, high moisture levels, or extensive mold growth is present. The detection of dust or carpet mites, or parts of other types of organisms in surface or airborne samples may be indicative of an infestation.

### Common Insect-Related Particles:

- Dust & carpet mites
- Moth wing scale
- Insect body hair

# CRYSTALLINE MINERAL DUST PARTICLES – Soil / construction dust

## Typical Crystalline Mineral Particle Concentration Ranges

| DESCRIPTION | Classification | Surface Cts/mm² | Airborne Cts/m³ |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Inside low and clean | Low | <5 | <4,000 |
| Inside low / typical background | Low / typical | 5 - 10 | 4,000 - 10,000 |
| Inside low-moderate dust source | Low-moderate | 10 - 50 | 10,000 - 20,000 |
| Inside moderate dust source | Moderate | 50 - 100 | 20,000 - 100,000 |
| Inside high actively generating source | High | >100 | >100,000 |

Crystalline mineral particles found indoors are generated by two primary sources, 1). Infiltrated and naturally occurring soil particles and, 2). Building construction and finish materials. Construction materials are composed mostly of carbonate and gypsum containing dust generated from the application and renovation of building components, drywall, patching compounds, flooring adhesives, and paint. Infiltrated soil minerals are mostly composed of naturally occurring aluminum silicate clays, quartz, and Calcium carbonates and sulfates. Mineral dust particles are categorized in the analysis as those particles that exhibit low to high birefringence in cross-polarized light.

### Common Crystalline Mineral Types:

- Drywall dust (gypsum) - 750x
- Calcium carbonate - 750x
- Quartz beach sand - dispersion staining - 100x
- Diatomite - 750x

# SUGGESTED AIRBORNE MOLD GUIDELINES DEVELOPED BY ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS

## INDOOR AIRBORNE MOLD SPORE INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES

*Developed by Environmental Analysis Associates, Inc. - 2003 - 2018*
*Laboratories located in Bay City, Michigan and San Diego, California*
*doc.rev.3 - 7/15/18*

The indoor air sample interpretation guidelines given below are based on the average mold spore concentration ranges found in typical office and residential environments throughout the country. The classifications are divided into 5 ranges of "High", "Moderate", "Low-moderate", "Typical-low", and "Low", and are based on our 30 years of experience providing mold analysis from a wide range of residential, commercial, office, hospital, and industrial buildings. Exceptions to any guidelines should be expected based upon varied building construction, usage, and HVAC filtration. Site specific exterior climatic conditions can also have a direct impact on the infiltration rate and measured background of mold spores found inside buildings. The presence or absence of vegetation both regionally and in close proximity to a building (e.g. forested, snow covered, or desert / paved urban areas), can directly affect the concentration and distribution of mold spores infiltrating into the building.

## Mold Spore Category Definitions

| Category | Description / Definition |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Total Mold Spores | Total concentration of all enumerated mold spores |
| Aspergillus/Penicillium | Penicillium or Aspergillus morphology (the most common molds associated with indoor growth) |
| Chronic Water Indicating Fungi | Mold genera associated with "chronic" indoor moisture (Stachybotrys, Chaetomium, Ulocladium, Trichoderma) |
| Typical Outdoor Fungi | Mold genera commonly found in outdoor air (Asco/Basidiopores, Cladosporium, and other listed spores) |
| Hyphae Fragments | Mold growth structures including hyphae (mycelia), phialides, perithecia, etc. |

*Note: Cladosporium may commonly grow indoors in sub-tropical climates as well as inside HVAC systems, and on window panes (from condensation). All molds genera listed can be found both indoors and outdoors. Finding low or isolated spores of any genera should be viewed as normal occurrence.*

Importantly, there is no simultaneous short-term relationship between indoor and outdoor mold/fungal spore concentrations. Outdoor airborne concentrations can vary 10-100 fold (e.g. 100-10,000 cts/m³) on an hour-by-hour basis depending on the sampling location, the meteorological conditions at the time of sample collection, the time of day, wind velocity, and seasonal variability. The indoor environment typically has a fewer number of variable conditions and the mold spore concentrations will typically vary no more than 2-5 fold (e.g. 500-2,500 cts/m³) over an entire week. Existing peer reviewed literature clearly states that performing simultaneous indoor/outdoor comparisons using limited data by itself, and without considering both the variability and magnitude of measured concentrations, is scientifically unreliable. One must also consider that the sampling and analysis variability on any individual sample can vary ± 30%. Although indoor spore concentrations are typically lower than the seasonal average for outdoor levels, measuring higher mold spore concentrations indoors (even in the absence of indoor mold growth sources) can be a common and normal occurrence. This is especially true in geographic or climatic locations where minimal exterior vegetation is present. A comparison with outdoor mold spore measurements is often more useful to help determine if the indoor environment is being impacted by outdoor mold spore infiltration from a site specific condition, or historically over an extended period of time. Historical data collected by EAA was used to develop classification ranges for both the concentration and distribution of mold spore genera, and then classify the results as compared to average "clean" indoor environments. Indoor concentration ranges (regardless of outdoor concentrations) are first used to classify the genera of Aspergillus and Penicillium, Chronic Water Indicating Fungi, and Outdoor fungi as "High", "Moderate", "Low-moderate", "Typical-low", and "Low" based on ranges given in the table given below. The Aspergillus/Penicillium and Water Indicating Fungi categories are mold spore genera most commonly associated with the presence of indoor growth. The Outdoor Fungi category (i.e. mold genera commonly found growing on soil and outdoor vegetation) is used to determine if the distribution of mold spores may be the result of outdoor mold spore infiltration. The EAA air sampling results and classification ranges should be used as secondary information to support a thorough visual inspection. A proper assessment of building contamination cannot directly be determined using air sampling results alone. Determining the presence of actual indoor mold growth and if there is an elevated exposure to a moldy environment, requires a thorough visual inspection, visual quantification of the location and extent of surface growth, and documenting the potential routes of exposure.

## CLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES - Average Residential and Commercial Buildings (Concentration/m³)

### Concentration Classification Table

| Concentration Classification | Total Spores | Aspergillus/Penicillium | Chronic Water Indicating | Outdoor Fungi | Hyphae Fragments |
|------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|------------------|
| Low | <500 | <500 | <50 | <200 | <100 |
| Typical-low | >500 | >500 | >50 | >200 | >100 |
| Low-moderate | >1000 | >750 | >100 | >500 | >500 |
| Moderate | >5000 | >1500 | >200 | >1000 | >1000 |
| High | >10000 | >5000 | >500 | >5000 | >2000 |

### Genera Distribution % (Potential Indoor verses Outdoor sources)

| Source Classification | Aspergillus/Penicillium % | Water Indicating ct/m³ | Outdoor Fungi % |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Indoor - low | <20% | < 50 | <20% |
| Indoor - typical | >20% | > 50 | >20% |
| Possible amplification | >50% | > 100 | >50% |
| Indoor amplification | >80% | > 300 | <20% |
| Outdoor infiltration | <20% | <50 | >2,000 cts/m³ |

### Classification Definitions:

- **Low** - Concentration range found in the average "clean" non-water impacted building
- **Typical-low** - Concentration range found in the average building (minimal history of water leaks or other water events)
- **Low-moderate** - Concentration range found in buildings with inadequate house-keeping and/or possible mold growth
- **Moderate** - Concentration range found in buildings with inadequate house-keeping and/or possible mold growth
- **High** - Concentration range found in buildings with evidence of significant mold growth

Although no classification system used to estimate the potential for indoor mold growth, or acceptable indoor spore concentrations can be relied upon in all situations, the Classification Guidelines given above (and supported in principle by published research referenced (below) are based upon the measured variability of spore concentrations and the genera distribution found inside clean and mold contaminated buildings. Although not applicable to all types of building environments, our classification criteria are more reliable than using indoor / outdoor comparisons to assess potential contamination. *The classification guidelines given above cannot be used to assess wall cavities or confined spaces.*

# SUGGESTED AIRBORNE DUST GUIDELINES DEVELOPED BY ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS

## INDOOR AIRBORNE DUST INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES

*Developed by Environmental Analysis Associates, Inc. - 2003 - 2018*
*Laboratories located in Bay City, Michigan and San Diego, California*
*doc.rev.3 - 7/15/18*

The indoor airborne dust classification categories used by EAA provide a systematic way to measure and evaluate the full range of particles generated by building occupants, renovation and maintenance activities, HVAC corrosion and degradation, and the filtration efficacy of the building. This is accomplished by quantifying and understanding the origin of the most common types of airborne dust particle contaminants. Based on our own historical building inspection observations and analysis data, the measured dust particle concentrations are classified in 5 ranges of "high", "moderate", "low-moderate", "low - typical", and "low". These ranges are not direct indicators of safe or unsafe conditions, nor should they be confused with EPA or OSHA exposure guidelines. The origin and impact of each dust particle category on indoor air quality is described and illustrated in the "Airborne and Surface Dust Analysis Interpretation Guide" provided on the News and Information page of the eaalab.com website. Additional analysis of particle size distribution and inorganic particle chemistry can also be provided by automated SEM / X-ray analysis. The automated SEM/X-ray sampling and analysis methods are also described in the interpretation guide.

## Particle Classification Definitions

| CLASSIFICATION | DESCRIPTION |
|----------------|-------------|
| Pollen | Reproductive spores of flowers |
| Skin cell fragments | Epithelial cells / dander |
| Fiberglass | Man-made fibrous glass fibers (fiberglass, mineral wool) |
| Cellulose / Synthetic | Cellulosic, fabric, synthetic fibers (nylon, rayon, etc.) |
| Unidentified Opaque | Opaque debris (biological decay, tire rubber, corrosion, paint, etc.) |
| Soil / Mineral | Soil, crystalline minerals, construction dust particles |
| Fire residue | Combustion soot, ash, char, other assemblage indicator particles |
| * Other | Specific unusual and atypical particles |
| | *Examples: Copier toner, paint flakes, unusual fibers, feather fibrils, starch grains, etc.* |
| | *To be handled on a case-by-case basis* |

No quantitative assessment criteria are used for the following:

| Category | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| Insect parts | *Concentration range similar to cellulose range* |
| Algae/Fern spores | *Concentration range similar to cellulose range* |

## CLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES - Average Residential and Commercial Buildings (Concentration/m³)

| High | >150 | >20000 | >100 | >1500 | >10000 | >100000 | >10000 | > 1500 |

*\* Reported individually under the "Special Comments Section" - Concentration ranges may vary by type of particle*

### Classification Definitions:

- **Low** - Concentration range found in the average "clean" non-impacted building.
- **Typical - low** - Concentration range found in the average building
- **Low-moderate** - Concentration range found in buildings with infrequent cleaning or high occupancy
- **Moderate** - Concentration range found in buildings with possible generating sources, infrequent cleaning, and/or inadequate filtration
- **High** - Concentration range found in buildings with indoor generating sources and/or significant infiltration

*Note: Pollen level assessment criteria are based on the prevalence of pollen encountered by EAA in indoor environments and not by the general assessment criterion published by the National Allergy Bureau for outdoor airborne levels.*

Although no classification system used to estimate potential contamination can cover all conditions, EAA's system follows industry accepted scientific guidelines outlined in Chapter 14.2.2 of the ACGIH 1999 document *Bioaerosols: Assessment and Control* for the comparison of indoor and outdoor data. Average levels measured inside buildings with very high occupant activity (auditoriums, classrooms, etc.), operations involving industrial activities, or buildings without routine HVAC supplied air will likely have significantly higher average ranges than indicated in the table above. These guidelines are not applicable for the evaluation of wall cavities, attics, crawl spaces, or other confined spaces.

# SUGGESTED SURFACE MOLD GUIDELINES DEVELOPED BY ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS

## INDOOR SURFACE MOLD SPORE INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES

*Developed by Environmental Analysis Associates, Inc. - 2003 - 2018*
*Laboratories located in San Diego, California & Bay City, Michigan*
*doc.rev.7 - 7/15/18*

The surface mold interpretation guidelines given below are based on 30 years experience collecting and analyzing samples from a wide range of building environments. The classification ranges were developed based on data collected from known "clean" residential and commercial buildings, and buildings with a history of water damage and/or mold growth. Exceptions to any guidelines should always be anticipated, especially in locations or climatic conditions where a very high or very low density of vegetation is present.

## Category Definitions

| Category | Description / Definition |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Total Spores | Total concentration of all enumerated spores |
| Aspergillus/Penicillium | Spores with Penicillium or Aspergillus morphology |
| Chronic water indicating fungi | Spores indicating "chronic" moisture (Stachybotrys, Chaetomium, Ulocladium, Trichoderma) |
| Typical Outdoor Fungi | Spores commonly found in outdoor air (Asco/Basidiopores, Cladosporium, Other) |
| Hyphae Fragments | Fungal growth structures including hyphae (mycelia), phialides, perithecia, etc. |

*Note: Cladosporium may commonly grow indoors in sub-tropical climates as well as inside HVAC systems, and with condensation on window panes.*

There is no direct relationship between indoor and outdoor surface mold spore concentrations, and existing peer reviewed mold concentration literature typically refers to indoor/outdoor comparisons of air samples. Very little published literature is available for surface mold spore concentrations. Based on our own experience, the variability and magnitude of measured settled surface concentrations can naturally vary 10,000-fold from less than 0.1 spores/mm² to over 1,000 spores/mm² depending upon environmental factors, location, and the frequency of surface cleaning. When surface "growth" is present, the measured spore and growth "structure" concentrations (e.g. mycelia, arthroconidia, phialides, perithecia, etc.) can range from 100 fungal structures/mm² to over 100,000 fungal structures/mm². When high concentrations of fungal structures and/or spores are measured from a discolored surface of suspect mold growth, the results simply indicate the presence of mold growth. Furthermore, there is no correlation or direct relationship to how much surface area is impacted, nor can the results be used to determine if an airborne hazard is present. Analysis results (by themselves) simply indicate the presence or absence of surface mold growth and/or the concentration of settled spores. Construction lumber and building materials can inherently contain moderate to high surface mold growth structures as purchased from the store or lumberyard. As a result, care must be exercised when interpreting the data collected from lumber, wood products, or other materials stored outdoors prior to being used inside the building. Moderate or high mold concentrations may indicate a pre-existing condition, and not necessarily mold growth or excessive settling that occurred after the material was brought inside the building being tested. Determining the extent of actual indoor mold growth, or an elevated exposure to a moldy environment, requires a thorough visual inspection, visual quantification of the location and extent of surface growth, and evaluation of other environmental factors.

## CLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES - Average Residential and Commercial Buildings (Concentration/mm²)

### Data collected from horizontal surfaces

| Concentration Classification | Total Spores | Aspergillus/Penicillium | Chronic Water Indicating | Typical Outdoor Fungi | Hyphae Fragments |
|------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Low | <0.1 | <0.1 | <0.1 | <0.1 | <0.1 |
| Typical-low | >0.1 | >0.1 | >0.1 | >0.1 | >0.1 |
| Low-moderate | >1.0 | <10 | >1.0 | >1.0 | >1.0 |
| Moderate | >10 | <20 | >5.0 | >10 | >10 |
| High | >100 | <50 | >10 | >20 | >50 |

### Classification Definitions:

- **Low** - Concentration range found in the average "clean" non-water impacted building
- **Typical-low** - Concentration range found in the average building (minimal history of water leaks or other water events)
- **Low-moderate** - Concentration range found in buildings with inadequate house-keeping and/or possible mold growth
- **Moderate** - Concentration range found in buildings with inadequate house-keeping and/or possible mold growth
- ***High** - Concentration range found in buildings with evidence of significant mold growth*

*\* Some construction lumber & materials may have a natural mold background and may not indicate a current settling or growth condition.*

Historical indoor data collected by EAA is used to classify the results as compared to average "clean" office and residential environments. The concentration classification ranges (regardless of outdoor concentrations) are first used to categorize Aspergillus and Penicillium, and Chronic Water Indicating (W.I.) fungi categories as "High", "Moderate", "Low-moderate", "Typical-low", and "Low". The spore genera distribution can also be used as a possible indication of indoor growth or outdoor air infiltration and subsequent settling. Indoor growth may be indicated when high Aspergillus/Penicillium or Water Indicating spore concentrations are present, or a moderate concentration of hyphae or other types of mold growth structures are present. Occasionally, measuring moderate to high concentrations of Cladosporium, certain basidiospores, or other hyaline fungi may also be indicators of indoor mold growth.

While no classification system used to estimate potential contamination or identify a mold growth source will be applicable to all individual building conditions, EAA's classification ranges are based sample analysis data from our own building inspections, and samples analyzed for other industrial hygiene firms from a wide range of building environments. **These concentration levels should not be used to assess wall cavities or confined spaces.**

# SUGGESTED SURFACE DUST GUIDELINES DEVELOPED BY ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS

## INDOOR SURFACE DUST INTERPRETATION GUIDELINES

*Developed by Environmental Analysis Associates, Inc. - 2003 - 2018*
*Laboratories located in San Diego, California & Bay City, Michigan*
*doc.rev.7 - 7/15/18*

The particle classifications used by EAA (and shown below) provide a concentration ranking of the most common dust contaminants settling on horizontal surfaces inside buildings. These indicator categories provide a direct reflection of dust generated by occupant activity, shedding of building materials, building maintenance, HVAC systems, building furnishings, renovation activities, and/or outdoor infiltration. The concentration ranges and classifications of "High", "Moderate", "Low-moderate", "Typical-low", or "Low" levels cannot directly be used as indicators of safe or unsafe conditions, nor should they be confused with EPA, OSHA, or other governmental exposure guidelines. These guidelines are useful for the comparison of settled dust concentrations in buildings, determining the presence or absence of construction renovation related dust, or to identify other potentially irritant or allergenic particles. The analysis results can also assist maintenance personnel in the determination of the source or origin of indoor air quality complaints, or evaluate the relative cleanliness of content surfaces. The potential association of each particle classification with building related conditions is illustrated in the EAA "Airborne and Surface Dust Analysis Interpretation Guide" on the News and Information page at eaalab.com.

| High | >10 | >100 | >1.0 | >10 | >100 | >100 | >50 | > 10 |

*\* Reported individually under the "Special Comments Section" - Concentration ranges may vary by type of particle*

### Classification Definitions:

- **Low** - Concentration range found in the average "clean" non-impacted building.
- **Typical-low** - Concentration range found in the average building
- **Low-moderate** - Concentration range found in buildings with inadequate house-keeping
- **Moderate** - Concentration range found in buildings with possible generating sources and/or inadequate filtration
- **High** - Concentration range found in buildings with indoor generating sources and/or significant infiltration

EAA's classification system follows basic guidelines outlined in Chapter 14.2.2 of the ACGIH 1999 document *Bioaerosols: Assessment and Control* by accounting for average baseline data inside buildings. Average levels measured inside buildings without routine HVAC supplied air, or residential dwellings may be higher. No classification system used can be expected to cover all conditions. **These concentration levels should not be used to assess wall cavities or confined spaces.**

*The "Estimated Area Ratio %" is the numerical "size/area adjusted" ratio between all particle categories based on the average estimated area of each particle category.*

*The "Surface density (Cts/mm2)" of fire residue particles is the numerical surface particle concentration independent of the amount or ratio of background dust.*

*\* Note: If the surface density of fire residue particles (cts/mm2) is not displayed, it was not analyzed due to significant sample overloading, or calculated on tape lift samples that are not "overloaded" with dust, or on filter samples collected from a known surface area and calculated serial dilution.*

*\* The summary guidelines for "Low", "upper background "Upper Bkg.", "Moderate", and "High" concentrations are based on the variance of quantitative background levels (area ratio% and cts/mm2) measured by EAA in buildings. The local geographic background, site specific conditions, and other potential combustion sources must be taken into account in order to determine if an elevated or atypical fire/combustion residue condition is present.*

### Fire / Combustion Residue Concentrations For Buildings

| Ratio % & Surface Concentrations | Classification Range | Total Fire Residue (ratio%) | Total Fire Residue (ct/mm2) |
|----------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| | Low | <1% | <1 |

*Note: Sample results are only applicable to the items or locations tested.*

*\* The SUMMARY CONCLUSIONS describing fire/combustion residue concentrations are based on both the "qualitative indicators" present, and the variance of "quantitative" background levels measured by EAA in typical buildings. The local geographic background, site specific conditions, and other potential combustion sources must be taken into account in order to determine if an elevated or atypical condition is present. The estimated surface particle concentrations per unit surface area (Cts/mm2) can only be calculated on surface tape lift samples.*

The data collected by the SEM and EDAX™ "Particle™" X-ray software is converted into a statistical report format developed by EAA. The analysis reports provide particle size distribution and elemental chemistry analysis designed for use by environmental health professionals. The reports provide direct estimates of quantitative sample chemistry, mass and size distribution, including mass estimates of respirable and inhalable sized dust (e.g. PM2.5 and PM10).

## SAMPLE COLLECTION METHODS

Different types of sample collection media can be used depending on the type of sample being analyzed. Bulk, vacuum, or adhesive tape lift media can be used to collect surface dust samples. The direct preparation of adhesive tape media is the preferred procedure to evaluate settled dust samples. Water samples can be filtered using 0.4µm polycarbonate filter media. Airborne samples can be collected using polycarbonate filters or Zefon™ Air-O-Cell CSI™ slit impaction samplers that contain adhesive media compatible with the SEM and Dispersive X-ray analysis.

## ANALYSIS METHOD SUMMARY

The SEM analysis method is utilized as a semi-quantitative diagnostic testing procedure to estimate the size and Elemental distribution of individual particles within a surface dust, airborne dust, or water sample. The method is well-suited to simultaneously provide gravimetric mass measurements when chemistry information cannot be collected by using conventional methods. Optical Microscopy methods are recommended for the analysis of biological fibers and particles (mold, pollen, etc.) and not SEM analysis. A flow diagram for the suggested use this method is given on page 4 of this document.

| Carbonaceous | Y - common | Biological synthetic particles fibers | M carbon ** |
| Asphaltic | N | Roofing / patching | S carbon |
| Quartz | Y - common | Concrete, sand, plasters | Quartz-like, Si oxide |
| Mixed silicate clays | Y - common | Soil infiltration, plasters, insulation | M Al silicate ** |
| Vermiculite | N | Spray on insulation (variable) | M Al silicate (special)** |
| Calcium sulfate | Y - rare | Drywall board / compounds | Ca sulfate |
| Calcium carbonate | Y - low | Concrete, patching compounds | Ca carbonate |
| Calcium silicate | Y - low | Concrete, patching compound, plasters | Ca silicate |

| Titanium Paints | N | Coatings - Wall, ceiling tiles, etc | M Ti oxide ** |
| **Corrosion Particles** | | | |
| Iron oxide | Y - moderate | Pipes, motors, HVAC components | Fe oxide |
| Al oxide | Y - moderate | HVAC, ducting, brackets, windows | Al oxide |

It is important to note that most materials are not "pure" and minor amounts (1-5%) of other common elements are usually found in association with each classification.

*\* The particle minor element chemistry and morphology occasionally needs to be considered to classify the particles appropriately*

*\*\* An "M" prefix refers to "mixed" element classification (e.g. M carbon for mixed carbon)*

*\* Wt% guidelines can vary based on particle geometry and background of the carbon substrate.*

*Note: This classification system is designed as a way to generally categorize (classify), and define the gross composition of an individual particle. The "classification" is first assigned based on the visual rank order elemental predominance in the X-ray spectrum. A chi-square classification fit of 65-75% is used. The name given to the "classified" particle is based on the most likely mineralogy found in the natural or indoor environment. The "classification" combinations may not always correctly define the exact composition of a particle, or always correctly represent the rank order quantitative elemental chemistry. Multiple sets of elemental ratio rules are used for "small" verses "large" particles due to increased beam penetration in particles smaller than 5um into the Carbon/Oxygen adhesive substrate. This limitation affects the measured apparent elemental stoichiometry. A 2nd manual review of particle spectra is conducted to verify particle ID.*
